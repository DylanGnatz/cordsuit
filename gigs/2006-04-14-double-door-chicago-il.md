## Review

The show was very, very good. David seemed bouyant and focused--I didn't notice any of the fumbling or wandering that earlier reviews had noted; he also has apparently memorized his lyrics, as he hardly used his notebook. The band was tight. The only disappointment was the absence of Bobby N.
