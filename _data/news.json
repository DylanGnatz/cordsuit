  "body": "== October Born ==From http://www.dragcity.com:Big news drops in October — in case you hadn’t already heard, October 18th is the date that the new Silver Jews opus Tanglewood Numbers becomes available to a world that has desperately needed more love from the Jews! You see, Silver Jews are a tradition to the young and semi-young of our global village — they quote David Berman’s lyrics, incorporating them as catch-phrases into their impressionable lives, fashion their lifestyles after what they imagine Silver Jews’ albums to be espousing and burn their favorite songs onto mix-CDs that they seek to influence others with, the cheap bitches! Ah, what we wouldn’t do for this fandom...it seems like the least we could do (literally) to release an album every four years or so from one of Drag City’s most celebrated of bands.Tanglewood Numbers is a celebration of life, played by more living creatures than ever before featured on a Silver Jews record. For all you dweebs out there: yes, Steve Malkmus is one of those creatures. And this helps to make Tanglewood Numbers one of the electric Jews records — as opposed to the more acoustically-flavored Bright Flight, let’s say. At times, the electricity is a bit shocking — but at the end of the day, it’s a great new Silver Jews record, full of life and death and beauty and humor and all the rest. Viva Tanglewood Numbers! It’s loaded with some of the greatest Silver Jews music.== Psst... ==From http://www.dragcity.com:Hey, American friend - wanna buy a really rare record? If you’re near a fine Drag City direct retailer, you’ll have a chance to buy one on October 18th. See, that’s the day Drag City’s little sister label Sea Note issues a mystery single so strange and mysterious...let's see, so strange and mysterious, we can’t tell you a single thing about this single! Well, perhaps just one little note — this record is related to our big October 18th release and a rumor that’s spread for some years over a collaboration with this band and another band on Drag City. That’s all we’re telling you - put together the pieces and five dollar bills and be the first in line - and you too might have this rarest of items!== Silver Jews vs. The Mountain Goats ==The CD accompanying the latest issue of The Believer magazine includes a version of Pet Politics played by the Mountain Goats. For more details visit: The Believer== False Alarm ==From http://www.donewaiting.com:All masters were located in another part of the building which received little to no fire damage. Whew!== Up In Smoke ==From NME:The studio Jeff Buckley was recording in when he died has been destroyed by fire.The Easley !McCain recording studio in Memphis suffered considerable damage after an electrical fire broke out on Wednesday last week (March 2).\"The (fire) inspector said that two fires broke out at the same time at opposite ends of the building, due to some electrical reason,\" engineer Kevin Cubbins told Rolling Stone. \"Within 15, 20 seconds, the whole place was engulfed.\"The studio has witnessed sessions by Sonic Youth, The White Stripes, Guided By Voices, Wilco and Loretta Lynn among others.Along with damage to the studio the new album by the band Silver Jews - which features former Pavement members - was also destroyed. The record had apparently been delivered to the studio to be mastered on the morning of the fire (see update).The studio’s future is now uncertain while the insurance is being examined, however Wilco bassist John Stirratt insisted it would a great loss.\"It's unbelievable. Really, really sad,\" he explained. \"If you tried to record in Memphis before Easley, you had to work with, well, born-agains. Easley was the first place to reflect how hip and weird and diverse Memphis really is -- the great, weird underbelly.\"== Punks in the Beerlight ==From The Dust Congress:Info on the upcoming Silver Jews album, from the main Jew:We won't be finished until Feb.24th.

  "body": "== Actual Air On Stage ==From http://www.infernalbridegroom.com:18th February 2003. Infernal Bridegroom Productions kicks off the new year with the first in a series of four consecutive world premiere productions, and the indie rock world is already buzzing about it.Having introduced Houston audiences to the works of Suzan-Lori Parks, Brian Jucha, Sarah Kane, Wallace Shawn, Mac Wellman and several other theater artists who represent the most exciting work happening in contemporary theater, IBP has found another outstanding playwright in rock and roll poet David Berman.  And, as was the case with our recent production of The Kinks’ Soap Opera, people from around the country are already booking their tickets.David Berman is a hero.  He is a hero to fans of independent music and he is a hero to the fans of contemporary American poetry.  Moreover he is a hero to longtime IBP company member Troy Schulze, who is uniquely suited to bring Berman’s poems to life and make believers out of the uninitiated.  Berman is best known for his work with The Silver Jews, a band which featured members of the legendary rock outfit Pavement.  As the story goes, Silver Jews mate Stephen Malkmus, of Pavement, was so impressed by Berman’s third record that he became disillusioned.  According to Malkmus, “It was such a better record than Terror Twilight [Pavement’s last release]. Much more inspired. After American Water, I could no longer make a record the way [Pavement] made records.”  In his book Actual Air, Berman has accomplished a similar feat: reawakening the listless world of American poetry, taking sly observatons on life’s mundane rigors and twisting them into mythic, witty, passionate anthems.  Berman's journey through a weird, dreamlike America is amusingly strange, yet it's strikingly familiar and precise. Pulitzer Prize-winning poet James Tate described Berman's poems as \"beautiful, strange, intelligent and funny ... narratives that freeze life in impossible contortions.\"Berman’s a hero, alright.  He’s a hero of the most exciting variety.  The sort you may never have heard of but you’ll almost certainly never forget.Troy Schulze joined the IBP company during it’s second production, in 1994.  In the time since, he’s played featured roles in 2 dozen productions, and was voted Houston’s best actor this year by Houston Press readers. In 1999, he directed Bernard- Marie Koltes' Roberto Zucco also for IBP. Houston Press theater critic Lee Williams wrote: \"[IBP's] exquisite world of wonderland shows just gets curiouser and curiouser and smarter and smarter. And the thrilling intellectual puzzle of their latest endeavor, \" Roberto Zucco,\" is as good as it gets.\"  Schulze is a funny sort of director.  Although his directing debut was an unmitigated success, he waited three years before mounting his sophomore effort.  He was looking for a project which demanded his attention and his unique, visually arresting style.   He found it in Actual Air.Schulze's stage adaptation of Berman's book is a collage of American snapshots – a surreal anti-narrative decorated with striking visuals, hilarious dialogue and live rock music, which is somehow simultaneously bizarre and accessible, soporific and dynamic.  As in the best of poetry, plays or music, it is the stuff dreams are made on.  Simply put, it’s the sort of work Infernal Bridegroom exists to produce: fresh, bold, challenging, entertaining, brand new poetry in motion for the next generation.In a pressurized cabin on the moon, a robot asks his maker about the relative sentience of snowmen.  In another scene an omniscient voice summons “all students named Doug” to a mysterious concourse.  In another a young man paints a self-portrait as a present to himself, meditating on simple pleasures and comforting himself with such thoughts as “at least I have not woken up with a bloody knife in my hand.”  As another sly rock poet once observed, something is happening and we don’t know what it is.  But something is absolutely happening.   It’s poetry made live again.  It’s theater made poetry.  And Infernal Bridegroom, and fans of David Berman from across the country, couldn’t be more excited.Ten years and forty-one shows after it all began, Infernal Bridegroom Productions is in its first full season in its very own theater doing what we've been doing all along.  Only more.   And better.  Actual Air is the first of four world premieres, to be followed by a collaboration with Bobbindoctrin Puppet Theatre (The Noblest of Drugs), a new work by IBP artistic director Jason Nodler (Meat/BAR) and the eighth in our ever-popular Tamalalia series.Actual Air will be playing at the Axiom, 2524 McKinney, at 8:00 p.m. on the following dates: February 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 27, 28, and March 1, 6, 7, 8. Opening Weekend, February 13, 14 and 15, tickets are only $5.99. Remaining performance ticket prices are as follows: Thursdays $10, Fridays $12, Saturdays $15.== Silver Jews T-shirt Bonanza ==Drag City have two splendid new Silver Jews t-shirts for sale! They're $14.00 each plus postage. Click here for more details. == Big chords, sweet melodies and (sometimes dubious) wisdom ==Typically, Silver Jews is the warmest, most homespun music of all the US stuff we represent; legendary leader DC Berman dropping the big chords, sweet melodies and (sometimes dubious) wisdom in equal parts. Bright Flight is a little different, a little the same - I read something about it that stuck with me, where the spin is that it's a little wilder and a little less kind than the Wild Kindness we experienced on the previous set, American Water. Maybe that's true, and the Nashville Joos sure sound lived-in, but DCB is incapable of sounding over-familar, naturally incorporating George Washington, Stephen Foster and Royal Trux into the best lyric schemes you're going to get outside hip-hop. Also Tennessee may well be the ultimate Joos track, if you ever need to turn a friend on to this incredible group in a hurry. And if it fails, well would you really want a friend who doesn't love this group? == Silver Jews Take Bright Flight To The Near Future ==Whenever we hear the sound of Silver Jews, it always seems to come from another time, a moment in the near future, perhaps. Their songs are like predictions that come true — moments of déjà vu played backwards, instantly familiar, making us nostalgic for a past that hasn't quite let go yet. Well, it's time for Silver Jews fans to prepare for such moments of time travel in the immediate future... around November 20th, to be precise! That's the day the new release Bright Flight will be made available, like an IV, to all the fans out there. This time, you'll have two new titles to choose from: not only the new 10-song Bright Flight LP/CD, but also a 4-track 12\"/CDEP called \"Tennessee.\" This 12\" is a cut from the record with three cuts not from the record adding up to a mini-trip all of it's own — who are you kidding, there's no choice! You've got four purchases to make an LP, CD, 12\" and CDEP! Start slinging that rock ASAP!And the record is great. Keeping in the tradition of not repeating past poses, D.C. Berman has typed up a new set of profiles. He assumes them all on Bright Flight, assisted by a couple characters from the American Water sessions (Tim Barnes, Mike Fellows) as well as a number of talented players from the Nashville area, where Bright Flight was laid down. This is one of those lonely-sounding, make-you-cry Silver Jews records so get ready for a cold winter. With Bright Flight in hand, it will be a long, devastating, worthwhile experience. This could be humanity s last chance so please — don t fuck it up, you kids at heart. Reality just got a little more real.== Actual Air ==D.C. Berman's first book of poetry, entitled Actual Air, was published by Open City Press on July 1st 1999.    \"David Berman's poems are beautiful, strange, intelligent and funny. They are narratives that freeze life in impossible contortions. They take the familiar and make it new, so new the reader is stunned and will not soon forget. I found much to savor on every page of Actual Air. It's a book for everyone.\" - James Tate The book costs $12.95 and can be ordered on-line. There has been a small first printing. "

My fifteen favorite ones.A dollar per song. Plus Arnett Hollow. I don'twant to keep you underground for too long. Fall Creek Falls State Park State Lodge is great by the way its like the one from a place wherein they called Falls -  Yes I cancelled the South American shows. I'll have to see the ABC Countries another way.I guess I am moving over to another category. Screenwriting or Muckraking.I've got to move on. Can't be like all the careerists doncha know.I'm forty two and I know what to do.I'm a writer, see?Cassie is taking it the hardest. She's a fan and a player but she sees how happy i am with the decision.I always said we would stop before we got bad. If I continue to record I might accidentally write the song answer to Shiny Happy People.What, you thought I was going to hang on to the bitter end like Marybeth Hamilton?love david== My Father, My Attack Dog ==Now that the Joos are over I can tell you my gravest secret. Worse than suicide, worse than crack addiction:My father.You might be surprised to know he is famous, for terrible reasons.My father is a despicable man. My father is a sort of human molestor.An exploiter. A scoundrel. A world historical motherfucking son of a bitch. (sorry grandma)You can read about him here.http://www.bermanexposed.orgMy life is so wierd. It's allegorical to the nth. My father went to college at Transylvania University.You see what I'm saying.A couple of years ago I demanded he stop his work. Close down his company or I would sever our relationship.He refused. He has just gotten worse. More evil. More powerful. We've been \"estranged\" for over three years.Even as a child I disliked him. We were opposites. I wanted to read. He wanted to play games.He is a union buster.When I got out of college I joined the Teamsters (the guards were union organized at the Whitney).I went off to hide in art and academia.I fled through this art portal for twenty years. In the mean time my Dad started a very very badcompany called Berman and Company.He props up fast food/soda/factory farming/childhood obesity and diabetes/drunk driving/secondhand smoke.He attacks animal lovers, ecologists, civil action attorneys, scientists, dieticians, doctors, teachers.His clients include everyone from the makers of Agent Orange to the Tanning Salon Owners of America.He helped ensure the minimum wage did not move a penny from 1997-2007!The worst part for me as a writer is what he does with the english language.Though vicious he is a doltish thinkerand his spurious editorials rely on doublethink and always with the Lashon Hara.As I studied Judaism over the years, the shame and the shanda,grew almost too much. my heart was constantly on fire for justice. I could find no relief.This winter I decided that the SJs were too small of a force to ever come close toundoing a millionth of all the harm he has caused. To you and everyone you know.Literally, if you eat food or have a job, he is reaching you.I've always hid this terrible shame from you, the fan. The SJs have always stood autonomous and clear.Hopefully it won't contaminate your feelings about the work.My life has been riddled with Ibsenism. In a way I am the son of a demon come to make good the damage.Previously I thought, through songs and poems and drawings I could find and build a refuge away from his world.But there is the matter of Justice.And i'll tell you it's not just a metaphor. The desire for it actually burns.It hurts.There needs to be something more. I'll see what that might be.DCBif you want to know what evil Herr Attackdog is currently up to look here:http://www.alternet.org/workplace/120426/ad_wars%3A_%27dr._evil%27_vs._unions_over_employee_free_choice_act/== News Archives ==* ((News 2003 and Before))* ((News 2004))* ((News 2005))* ((News 2006))* ((News 2007))* ((News 2008))"
