  "body": "From http://www.cokemachineglow.com== Interview: Dave Berman ==by Peter HepburnIn the now-defunct world of indie rock, Stephen Malkmus, Doug Martsch, Lou Barlow, J. Mascis, and Dave Berman stood as slightly larger people among boys. These guys had what it took; the guitar chops, the dry sense of humor, the personality. Of course now that the sort of cinematic, new wave, Talking Heads/David Bowie/Brian Eno-indebted independent music has come back into vogue, these guys’ record sales are smaller than ever, and their target audience isn’t getting any younger.Not that they haven’t been fighting back. Malkmus put out his strongest solo record, Face the Truth, earlier this year, and now Berman, far and away the best songwriter of the group, has released the Silver Jews’s long-anticipated fifth album: the fantastic Tanglewood Numbers. It’s the darkest, most concentrated album to date from The Silver Jews, and can stand to-to-toe with '98s indie classic American Water.So throw on that dusty old copy of Starlite Walker, kick back, and let Dave Berman tell it like it is.---CMG: : What are your five favorite records of all time? (I get to ask this because it's an email interview)Dave Berman (DB): These are the five that come to my mind: X Wild Gift, Charlie Rich Behind Closed Doors, The Darkness Permission to Land, Dinosaur Jr. You're Living All Over Me and R.E.M. Fables of the Reconstruction.CMG: What have you been listening to lately?DB: Mostly I listen to 650 AM. WSM. You can listen to it at WSMonline.com if you want a real country music education. Especially around lunchtime.CMG: Why don't you like CAN?DB: Everything is boring about them. What's more boring than a can? And they put okra on one of their album covers. I like Germans but not music from Germany.CMG: It seems like a lot of the music being made and received well critically today just doesn't have the things that made indie rock of the early to mid '90s great. There isn't that loose, relaxed feel, those sprawling guitars, or that inability to play one's instrument. Even Tanglewood Numbers feels like a record from someone distinctly older and wiser. Is indie rock dead? Does it matter?DB: If by indie rock you mean independently produced and distributed music, then no. If by indie rock you mean the barely overground music listened to by college age and college educated white humans in the nineteen nineties. then yes, it's dead. These names change you'll see. What they call \"post-punk\" now, at the time was called \"new wave.\"CMG: Do you worry about the Silver Jews becoming anachronistic in the face of this modern post-punk?DB: First let me clarify I meant the bands in the past (e.g. the cure/devo) that are now categorized as \"post-punk\" were called new wave at the time. Of course the term \"new wave\" had it's own obselence built into the word \"new\". Am I afraid of going out of style in the face of the out of style style that's in style again? No.CMG: What do you think of Arcade Fire?DB: Cassie plays them in her car. I pretend not to like it but probably I do.CMG: Which of your albums are you most proud of? Any particular songs stand out for you?DB: Well I'm proud of the first one for pulling it off. And the second one for getting through it. Nothing is standing out this very second.CMG: Do you ever go back and hear an early song and just absolutely hate it?DB: Yes. But I probably hated it back then, too. In other words, my estimation of the songs hasn't changed much.CMG: One sentence describing the last five years of your life:DB: The problems of the mind cannot be solved on the level of the mind.CMG: I've always been curious, with relation to \"Advice to the Graduate,\" what is a band called the Silver Jews doing singing with Catholic terminology?DB: We all inherit the western traditions of which the Catholic Church is a major fount.CMG: Any plans in the works for a follow-up to Actual Air?DB: Not right now.CMG: Is there a self-portrait at 38? What's the outlook?DB: It is an outlook. Not such an inlook like when I was 28.CMG: How many times have the Silver Jews played live?DB: Ten, maybe.CMG: Is there any way you can be convinced to tour?DB: If it paid well and I could figure out away to get off by myself.CMG: If you did go out, who would you want opening?DB: The Azita Yousseffi Band.CMG: Does the Silver Jews-Pavement link (or perception thereof) bother you? The Silver Jews were around first, after all. How about the fact that you still have to answer questions from punk kids about somebody else's band?DB: No. It did up through 1998 maybe. Now it seems kind of quaint.CMG: On that note, I've read that Slanted & Enchanted was the name of a comic strip you drew in your UVA days. What was it about? Do you still have any of the strips?DB: It wasn't a comic strip. Was that in that terrible Pavement book? That is such a piece of garbage. It was a drawing I had made of a figure on Whitney museum stationary and had written the phrase below it. It was taped to Bob's door in the apartment in Jersey City I shared with him and Steve.CMG: What did you major in at UVA?DB: Englsih.CMG: Tell me about working at the Whitney with Malkmus. How well did you two know each other? How did you get the job? Was Nastanovich working with you too? Where were you with school when you worked there? How'd you get from Virginia to New York?DB: Pretty well I imagine. I got hired out of an ad in the paper. Steve had a shitty job at a bargain book company. So when there was an opening I brought him in then West. It was good. We were teamsters, the guards, and had excellent benefits. Bob was a bus driver for a ferry that went from Hoboken to midtown. You got off there and Bob drove a shuttle bus to different office buildings. Bob and I graduated in 89. He moved to Jersey City. I moved back to Dallas. Then Austin. Around Christmas I drove up to live with Bob. Steve had spent the year and half traveling and recording a seven inch. He moved from California around the same time.CMG: In all of that, when exactly did the Silver Jews come together? Bob, Steve, and West all ended up in Pavement; were you ever invited to join in with them?DB: Let's see. When the three of us moved to the New York area Steve’s 2 7-inches had become somewhat of a little sensation among the musically educated. The first years this built. I remember when we first moved in, Steve playing me the songs from Perfect Sound Forever, which I think he had just recorded before he left and wouldn’t come out for 6 months, on the acoustic guitar standing in this doorway. I remember thinking \"wow he's gotten a lot better than he was in college.” This was right in the time he was turning from nerd into stylin'/jaded man. There was no middle stage really. We all change. We were all nerds in a way. Thrilled to sit next to David Yow at a bar, or \"look there's the singer from pussy galore!\"CMG: Even though all of your records have had their own specific character, in many ways Tanglewood Numbers feels like the most extreme break. What did you go into the studio looking to do with this record?DB: I wanted everything to be more emphatic. To grab people's attention. I didn't think the Silver Jews commanded enough respect. We were basically buried. No where to be found in the catalogues of rock criticism. Check your local Spin Guide to the ‘90s.CMG: It's funny you should put it that way, 'cause it seems like there are plenty of critics (myself included) who would readily state that American Water is as good as anything Pavement ever did, but it never gets quite the recognition it deserves. When the slacker stereotype was such a distinguishing characteristic of early-'90s indie rock that you played a significant role in creating, do you find it strange to be taking a more ambitious stance? Did you ever buy into that?DB: Because I don't play live and tour, I don't have many relationships with musicians and music fans as you would imagine. You may notice we are never on tribute albums and compilations, etc. We (I) have never been part of a music community. So the only thing I find strange is when people expect me to know the people in Sebadoh and Superchunk or the Mekons. All the musicians I know are on this record. I am 38 and my life as an involved-show-going-music-fan/musician ended well over ten years ago.CMG: To what degree do you see it as a political record?DB: I haven't decided how political it is.CMG: This is probably the best band you've had backing you on any of your records --- it just sounds like a full, cohesive unit working really well. Have you considered pulling a Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy and going back and re-doing some of your older songs with this crew?DB: I wouldn't want to insult the other versions.CMG: Aw, c'mon, not even \"The Frontier Index\" or \"Ballad of a Reverend War Character\"? Those two would be great with the band you had going for Tanglewood Numbers.DB: Yeah maybe that second one. The other version is not such a good version.CMG: Was this record more collaborative than your other ones?DB: Less in the sense that I took way more control. More collaborative in the sense that I used a lot more people.CMG: Why no instrumental track?DB: There was one but it gots some vocals put on to it. “How Can I Love You” used to be an instrumental called \"Belle Toke.\" Which was Will's old phone number in New York. BEL-TOKE.CMG: What's your favorite track on the record? What's Cassie's favorite?DB: I like song number one (“Punks in the Beerlight”) the best. Cassie would probably say number three (“K-Hole”).CMG: Do you worry that people just aren't gonna get it or just won't like the musical choices?DB: I worried about that earlier this summer when no one was giving me any responses. It's weird. I told this to Cassie before it happened. When you make a record and send it all your friends, your phone goes dead. No one calls you anymore. Name your reason, but that's what I’ve found with every record. Even from the record label. You don't get any feedback.CMG: What do you have to prove to the critics at this point?DB: That we deserve some of the respect usually diverted to the artist known as Fiona Apple.CMG: Crooked Rain has sold 237,000 in just over 10 years. The rapper Young Jeezy sold 170,000 copies of his debut record, the cleverly titled Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101, in one week. Does that sort of number discourage you?DB: Precedent doesn't discourage me anymore. I think we live in a time when unprecedented things (for the good and bad) are happening faster than we can comprehend.CMG: How many copies has American Water sold?DB: No more than 30,000.CMG: The first track on CocoRosie's Noah's Ark is titled \"K-Hole.\" Is Special K making a big come back in indie circles? Is a CocoRosie/Silver Jews duet inevitable?DB: My song is about the K Street Project. I think theirs is about some drug.CMG: Can Kanye save us? Can Walt Whitman?DB: Absolutely not.CMG: I was watching TV today down here (I'm living in Santiago de Chile right now) and I heard Joanna Newsom's \"Peach, Plum, Pear\" used in a bank commercial. Is there a God?DB: Yes but he has granted free will to all advertising executives to do good or evil as they wish."

  "title": "From a Texaco Sign",
  "body": "From http://www.popmatters.com:== From a Texaco Sign: An Interview with Silver Jews ==1 November 2005The Silver Jews' David Berman on secret tapes and a mission from God.by Matt GonzalesAbout 10 years ago I bought The Arizona Record by the Silver Jews because it listed R. Nastanovich (Bob Nastanovich, the percussionist for Pavement) as one of the members, along with D.C. Berman and Hazel Figurine. At the time I was hot for anything remotely Pavement-related, and was later elated when I figured out that guitarist Hazel Figurine was really Steve Malkmus. The record itself sounded more or less like a folkier Pavement, with Malkmus singing backing vocals and some lead vocals on every song. It wasn't easy listening; it sounded as if they'd sat a boom box down in the room and pressed record before launching into each song -- which is exactly what they did.I bought every subsequent Silver Jews album, and as I began to see them less as a Pavement side project and more as songwriter and poet David Berman's band, I grew enamored with Berman's slightly Southern-inflected and often talky delivery of simultaenously vague and vivid places, people, and psychological states. What really kept me coming back to Berman's songs was the persistent theme of loneliness that inhabited them. The characters in Berman's songs always seemed to find themselves stuck alone in bleak hotel rooms, dive bars, garish cities, and sometimes, the songs themselves.Take \"New Orleans\" from Starlite Walker where Berman and Malkmus howl together that they're \"trapped inside this song where the nights are so long\" until it morphs into \"there's traps inside us all and the knifes are so tall\". Then, on The Natural Bridge, Berman sings of being stuck \"inside the golden days of missing you, with the people of Cleveland who've suffered for so many years\". On American Water's \"We Are Real\" he sings \"My ski vest has buttons like convenience store mirrors and they help me see, that everything in this room right now is a part of me\". \"Time Will Break the World\", from 2001's Bright Flight, explains that \"the icicles are dripping like the whole house is weeping.\"Now, on Tanglewood Numbers, the first Silver Jews album in four years, Berman has found perspective. \"Like a brown bird nesting in a Texaco sign I've got a point of view,\" he sings on \"I'm Getting Back into Getting Back into You.\"The perspective was hard won. As Berman revealed recently, he tried to kill himself a couple of years ago with a combination of Xanax and crack. After his recovery and subsequent rehabilitation, he found solace in reading the Torah. Listening to Tanglewood Numbers, it doesn't sound so much like Berman found God as he met Him head on. On the album's stunning closer, \"There Is a Place\", Berman chants::    \"I saw God's shadow on this world:    I could not love the world entire:    There grew a desert in my mind:    I took a hammer to it all.\"Halfway into the album's snarling second track, \"Sometimes a Pony Gets Depressed,\" those who have been listening to Berman for the last ten years will know they are hearing a changed man; a man who has found a new measure of freedom. Freedom from rooms, cities, and songs; freedom to see things from a new angle. Freedom, it seems to at least some degree, from himself.Berman recently answered some of my questions via e-mail. Below is our correspondence.PopMatters: Which most satisfies you: 1) Putting your songs together in the studio, 2) playing guitar and singing on the porch or in your living room, or 3) having just finished a poem that you feel good about?David Berman: One and three. I don't take much pleasure in the activity of making music live, even around the house. Isn't that terrible? I guess I'm obsessed with achievement. I wouldn't sell me an important guitar.PM: Tanglewood Numbers is what a lot of people would probably call a \"departure\". More rockin'. Female backing vocals from your wife, Cassie. Why did it turn out that way?DB: Bright Flight was supposed to be the departure. It says so right in the title. But this record, yes, it's different. When I write songs now I'm able to use my intentions to steer. Before I kind of worked with the music that I'd received (out of luck or from the aether). I 've barely written more than fifty songs, and I've always been slow to achieve control. I'd like to write 50 more with what I've figured out in the last year.PM: Any news on when those early Silver Jews tapes of you, Steve Malkmus, and Bob Nastanovich improvising songs will be edited down, mastered, and released?DB: There are three shoeboxes of tapes I need to go through for that record to happen. I'm kind of offended by bands that try to sell you their DVDs, unreleaseds, tour-onlies, remixes, etc. It's kind of sad. I think a certain amount of reserve with regard to what you release is neccessary to avoid letting the listener degrade him or herself in their pursuit of trivia, irrespective to what it says about an artist's confidence in his work to come.PM: You've said that these days you are more open to the idea of \"peddling\" your music by performing live. Naturally, that excites your fan base because so few have seen the Silver Jews live. What, other than financial concerns, has brought about this change of heart?DB: 1) I'm on a mission from G-d. 2) I'm not joking.PM: In what ways did working with your wife Cassie on the album influence Tanglewood Numbers?DB: It closed the loop as I was trying to make the music circumscribe my entire life. There are many real people that I love inside this record. I believe it was made with care for other lives and other situations, however congruent or not with my own.PM: Now that you've managed to make a name for yourself as a legitimate poet, first with Actual Air, and now writing regularly for The Believer magazine, what advice would you give to other young poets trying to get published?DB: It seems to me that poets have had the best of luck when they have grouped together. One voice may no longer be able to penentrate the media. Find some other people like you, or as close as you can get, who have high ambitions for their writing and make each other better.PM: When will your next book of poetry be published?DB: I'm not really planning that. I can only do one thing per year. Didn't you want me to get started on that box of tapes?PM: Your singing sounds more emotionally unhinged on the new album than on previous ones. Why?DB: A late in life realization that acting was something I was permitted to do. And I think a more true to life represenation of my inner self was the result of filtering that same self through character, which surprised me. The fact that there were any surprises left surprised me. So I'm angled for more.PM: In the insert for a Scud Mountain Boys CD you once wrote: \"I'm renewing my vow to bear down on the truth even if there is none for the hundredth time.\" Do you feel like over the years you've maintained that tenacity to \"bear down on the truth\"? Or have you found yourself becoming satisfied with what you've found (or not found) as you get older?DB: As I was saying in the last answer, I am blown away to realize in my late 30s how wrong my old ideas about life and the works of life are. I'm blown away because I remember how it felt to believe those things were true.PM: The Natural Bridge stands as my favorite Silver Jews album, not because I think it's better than the rest, but because I happened to find it at a particularly difficult time in my life. Listening to that album was uplifting for me in a way that's hard to explain: I guess I felt like I had someone to be sad with. And not Joy Division, sink-into-the-oblivion sad -- but a more reconciled kind of sad. You've said that recording that record was a difficult time for you. I don't really want to ask you to explain why, but I would be interested in reading any thoughts this circuitous \"question\" might have conjured, if you're up to it.DB: The joke about the kid and his dad was something I heard Randy Travis tell at a concert in an arena in Baltimore in '95. The title of \"Golden Days of Missing You\" is a perversion of some garbled talk I heard on Saturday Night Live that year. The first two lines of the second verse of the first song are lifted from a Sam Cooke song."

  "title": "Interview with VERBAL ROCKET Fanzine",
  "body": "Hi there, Introduce yourself and your band please? Hello, I'm David: and this is the band: Peyton Pinkerton and William Tyler on guitar.Tony Crow, keyboards. Brian Kotzur: drums and my bass Cassie who plays wife. Are the band you tour with the band you are now recording with? Yes. I warmed them up for six months and then I let them rest a year. Next, I throw them in the studio with no time to prepare, then I disappear with the tapes and screen all their calls for 2-3 months. The earlier silver jews songs sounded like rough ideas which were quickly recorded, was that the case? That's it. 'Rough ideas. Quickly Recorded.' By the time of the time of the natural bridge all the songs were much more coherent and more 'perfectly formed', was there a turning point for you in terms of your song writing? The turning point was likely the city of Hartford, CT where the album was recorded. I don't want to tear down their city, but I think I was compelled to create these adjunct worlds to which I could flee to under stress. When did you move to Nashville and do you think moving there changed your music at all? 1998. I think it helped me to decide that music could be a lifelong art. The rock precedence is not promising in that regard. When recording the songs for the Arizona record, what were your influences? I only ask this because the first time I heard Jackson Nightz I was listening to music on shuffle and I thought I was listening to Sebadoh. Well, definitely not Sebadoh! I'm sure both songs were influenced by the Daniel Johnston cassettes.Have you ever considered re-recording any of the songs off the Arizona record? Secret Knowledge of Backroads and Jackson Nightz in particular stand out to me on this record. I guess if I'm ever struggling for reasons to be relevant, you know touring 'American Water', etc. I might go lower. What was the inspiration behind 'I remember me'? Was it based on anything? It was based on a fear I had about losing my bass player. Purposely a little purple, the song was supposed to scare me in to getting married by painting an awful loneliness. When you felt low in what way did it affect your lyrics? Did you feel you became more reserved in what you wrote or did you find writing a way of expressing how you felt? Or could you simply not write? Any depressing writing I've done, was mostly done in 'good times' looking back, mapping the contours of the bad times, delineating them, or extracting them via psychic surgery. Prior to touring I understand the only kind of gigs you played would be a few songs at parties. Was this true and if so can you give an account of what these performances were like? What songs you would play and who would perform with you etc? I got trapped into playing in a bar in Houston after it was closed. The owner had a guitar and when I said I didn't remember the chords or the words to any of my songs, he ran upstairs to his apartment and brought down a three ring binder with guitar tabs for all four albums.It has been 8 years since the publication of Actual Air, can we expect any more of your poetry to be published? That is something I need to think about more. With your writing, when you put pen to paper do you know what you're going to write? Or can a lyric turn into a poem into a story? If I make the decision to write something, it is to fulfil a need I have for a song or a poem. Someone needs a poem from me and I can't politely put it off anymore. I need two more songs to make an album. Dreaming up the content is the second step.I wouldn't be surprised if I learnt that you had written a novel, Is this something you'd be interested in doing? No, I think I prefer short forms. I don't consider prose fiction to be relevant anymore, anyway."

  "title": "Chapter 57 Interview",
  "body": "Interview with David Berman of the Silver Jews Conducted by M.Edwards in 1996 for a zine called Chapter 57In the Fall of 1996 I was employed as a seafood clerk at a supermarket, I was also listening to the Natural Bridge quite a bit. I had the idea to interview David for a zine I was planning on putting out back then. I wrote out a group of questions while standing behind the seafood counter (the smell of week old perch in my nostrils and lack of sleep may have had something to do with some of these questions) and sent them off. Not long after I was surprised to see a letter from David; he had replied to every question and sent a photo to boot! It always bothered me that the zine never saw the light of day and David's generosity went unrewarded. I hope to mend the situation by publishing it here for the first time in honor of the release of Tanglewood Numbers. - M. EdwardsME: Is that your car pictured on the back of The Natural Bridge insert? DCB: That photo is of the interior of a 1979 Subaru station wagon that I owned for one summer in the early nineties. it had a tiny engine that would top out at about 25 m.p.h.. That was great in school zones but I kept getting pulled over by cops for going too slow. ME: How is it in Charlottesville right now? DCB: Charlottesville is a good place to live right now. It was a up and down year if you're a Cavaliers football fan. I was lucky enough to attend the North Carolina and Texas games with their accompanying post-game celebrations and on the other hand nearly hospitalized for depression after losses to Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech, and Clemson. Once Charlottesville was ruled by the legacy of Thomas Jefferson. Recently Dave Matthews knocked TJ off the throne. We worship his jams now. ME: Is the Silver Jews your job now, or are you employed somewhere else? Do you have any memorable first jobs? I once worked 10 hour nights painting a restaurant by myself, I think I ate my weight in club sandwiches. DCB: I've been unemployed for about two years. Somewhere a rumor started that I was teaching at a university. That would be nice if it were true. I wouldn't mind at all. From 12-15 I groomed horses. At 15 I got my break in the dishwashing field, that lasted until I heard Hollywood calling and was hired to tear tickets at a Loew's theater. In college I got hired by the hospital to take the dead to the morgue and put them in the fridge. That lasted 3 years before I went back to dishwashing. In New York I was a security guard at the Whitney Museum of American Art for three years. I have no skills. I am currently unemployed. ME: Speaking of work, I was reading the lyrics to The Natural Bridge on the clock yesterday, when a woman I work with snatched it and began reading it, after about thirty seconds she said, \"Gosh, they sure do use the word Cum a lot don't they?\". DCB: Cum shows up three times on the record. When I was a kid people always used to say \"cumbucket\". It made a picture in my mind, cum slopped over the edges. I forgot about the word for years until forming this album it came up again and kept sneaking into songs. Cum is a very private issue. The Natural Bridge has a lot of privacy issues going on inside. ME: How do you write the lyrics that fill Silver Jews records? Is there a process or is it just a moment by moment kind of thing? DCB: First I write some simple music. Play it for a couple days until it begins to make its own lyrical demands. Try to fill the order as best you can. Mood is the touchstone. It's definitely not spontaneous. ME: In the song \"Frontier Index\" you use the term \"Sub-space\", what is the sub- space? is that like your separated perception of this reality? Everyone having a sub-space to move in the over-space. DCB: What is sub-space? I don't know. It just sounds cool. No, just kidding. Well I'm only half-kidding. The other half is this: I might use a concept like sub-space because I know it has meaning, I even know what it is, you even know what it is or you wouldn't have brought it up, but we probably won't have much luck talking about it. There is a level at which I can refer, I can even understand but I am not articulate enough to explain. Religion is nice that way, it only requires an ability to do the first two things. ME: \"Ballad\" is another interesting song on The Natural Bridge. Who is the \"extra in our midst\"? DCB: \"The extra in our midst\" is supposed to be the devil, from the perspective of the reverend the devil has brought these different characters to their individual miseries. This is not the way I see the world. It's funny though, I found out after I wrote the song, by reading the \"Origin of Satan\" by Elaine Pagels that in ancient Israel census taking was against Jewish law. King David tried to have one taken in 1000 B.C. for the purposes of taxation. The people were very upset and tried to revolt. In the old testament (I Chronicles 21:1) it is explained that Satan tempted David into instituting the census. ME: Do you have a favorite type of pants? A lot of stores in my area quit carrying Levi 517's, which has forced me too country/western department stores in London, Ky. DCB: I like dark blue Duckheads, plain fronts, size 36 waist, 32 length. ME: What was your favorite class through out your collegiate career? DCB: My favorite class was Forest Fire Management in the Forestry Dept. ME: If you were stranded on an island and you happened to bring a book with you, what do you hope that book would be? DCB: I don't know it would have to be something that you could go back to time and time again which for me would discount a novel. I guess I would bring somebody's collected poems. Probably Wallace Stevens'. ME: Have you ever visited Louisville? What were your impressions of this town? DCB: Yes I've been to Louisville two times for 24 hours a piece. I liked it very much one of those times. Western Ky struck me as being like a mixture of Indiana and Tennessee. I think Brown and Williamson makes shitty cigarettes and I have zero interest in racing, but any town that is responsible for Brett Ralph and Fading Out is A-OK with me. ME: Was the lyrics to \"Rebel Jew\" a first person narrative of your own true heart, or were you writing from another perspective? DCB: In \"Rebel Jew\" only the third verse/chorus is strictly from my perspective. The first two are those strange mixtures: a little of who you are, a little of who you might have been if things had gone differently, and a little of who you'd like to be. ME: Did your parents ever attend any cool concerts, back in the day? My mom claims to have seen The Beatles in Cincinnati, when she was 14. I heard you were conceived at Woodstock. DCB: My stepmother saw Jimi Hendrix and the Doors in Dallas. My Dad met Gerald Ford. ME: So what's the skinny, do you like Pearl Jam or not? DCB: No I don't like Pearl Jam. I tried. Alice in Chains is much better. Nirvana was boring. Soundgarden has a lot of great songs. Their greatest hits record will kick ass. ME: Do you have any collaborations planned? DCB: No I don't have any collaborations planned outside of sex with my girlfriend. Wait this is a family magazine. Apparently all the gold ever mined would fit into a cube 3 x 20 yards."

  "title": "Don't Fall For the Traps of the Man Who Was Never Born",
  "body": "When I conducted this interview back in October of 1997 I was young enough to be excited, but not exactly surprised that I was granted the opportunity to spend a day with one of my heroes, David Berman. I decided I wanted to interview Berman—I was not, and still am not, affiliated with any publication— so I wrote him a letter and hoped he’d agree to sit and answer my questions. When I returned from a family vacation in Texas I received a postcard from Berman explaining that he’d be in New York representing Drag City at CMJ and he was available for an interview session. I was given a phone number to call on the specified date and I did as I was instructed. When I first called a strange man answered and had fun with me. This man would later turn out to be Drag City’s Dan Koretsky and he told me that a man was impersonating David Berman and sullying his good name and they had to be careful about who they let speak to Berman. After a bit of this the phone was passed over to a croaking Berman. He was warm and casual and explained his scratchy voice by saying he’d stayed up too late drinking and smoking. We discussed plans to meet and I was told I could find Berman at Florent on Gansevoort Street in the meatpacking district in Manhattan \"with a red carnation in my buttonhole\". On my way to the restaurant I walked past my first transvestite hooker. I was nervous. I’d never interviewed anyone before and I was less self-assured when I was 19 than I am now at 27. Despite my shyness I consciously sought out experiences that would change my life. I was happy. When I reached the table that Berman sat at I was surprised to see several other unshaved men sitting around a table eating the remnants of a late breakfast. Berman politely introduced me to Dan Koretsky, DV DeVincentis, David Pajo and Will Oldham. I sensed that I was interrupting something so I quietly sat as a waiter filled a glass with water for me. Dan Koretsky posed for a picture with Will Oldham holding a wad of crisp bills fanned out in front of his face. Berman explained to me that Koretsky always made you take a picture with the cash he’d loaned you for proof of the exchange. Oldham jumped up after the photo was taken and left with Pajo to go record shopping. After they left Berman and Koretsky began arguing about expenses Berman had incurred on his trip to New York City. Berman wanted to be reimbursed and Koretsky was giving him a hard time. He sat back in his seat in a khaki safari vest and yellow tinted aviator sunglasses. With his bushy beard and taunting eyes he had the look of a man affecting a Hunter S. Thompson look so as to make strong-arming his record label’s roster easier for him. It seemed like he was having himself a good time playing the asshole record executive. He asked Berman, \"You have any receipts for the taxi from Newark? I’m gonna need to see the receipt.\" Berman first insisted he had receipts but then became exasperated at Koretsky’s smile and complained, \"You know I don’t. Just give me the money.\" I was uncomfortable watching this exchange and was relieved when we stood up to leave. We were headed over to Other Music on Fourth Street. There was a slight bit of controversy because Drag City had paid for a window display for the then newish Silver Jews record The Natural Bridge, but the Jewish owner of the space that Other Music leased had supposedly seen the advertisement and decided that the band name Silver Jews was anti-Semitic. Even when it was explained that the principle member of the band, David Berman, was himself Jewish the owner insisted that the advertising be taken down. This incensed both Koretsky and Berman to a point where on the way to Other Music they planned to storm the store and make a fuss. Somewhere between Florent and Other Music Berman picked up a large rubber band and a single tennis ball on the street and carried these items with him. When we reached Other Music Marcellus Hall’s band, White Hassle, were finishing up a set they played outside the store. After some small talk he packed up his equipment and left. Koretsky went inside to talk to Other Music people while Berman chatted with a woman from the P.R. company Drag City used. She had a toddler with her and Berman first offered him the rubber band, then the tennis ball and finally his driver’s license and credit card. The kid refused all. He seemed unnervingly humorless for a three year old. Instead of creating a commotion Berman suggested we go to the Strand. The next summer I found a job at the Strand among the refuse that sought employment there—the former junkies, trannies, and would be artists—and watched while they engaged in the co-dependent relationship the Strand fostered among its staff. The store gave $50 credit on the week’s paycheck, which really helped the drug addicts on staff cop their fixes, but never allowed them to move beyond the comfortable den they’d made for themselves amidst the 80 miles of books. As you walk into the Strand you meet a bored college kid manning the bag check. Berman checked his tennis ball and rubber band (now wound around the ball) and asked the clerk what was the strangest thing he’d checked. The guy mentioned a rotisserie chicken, and satisfied with his answer, Berman walked into the store. I followed him around as he plucked books from the piles and listened to his pronouncements on the books—\"A Confederacy of Dunces\" was panned and \"Underworld\" by Delillo was bought. Berman worried about his next credit card statement but bought the pile anyway. After the shopping we walked north to the hotel room he was sharing with other Drag City people. We passed the gated garden in Gramercy Park and admired the foliage we could only look at. We stopped at a corner deli where Berman purchased an iced tea and a nectarine. He offered to buy me a snack but I politely refused. We’d been talking the whole time, and the circuit from Gansevoort Street back up to the East 20’s was a long one, but we had not yet begun the actual interview. I feel lucky to have spent the day with a writer and musician I respect as much as I respect David Berman. We talked about music and writing—I was a writing major at the time and felt self conscious about my work—and there was never a point where Berman made me feel like a kid or patronized me. Instead of turning me off to writers he made me feel like I was just one of many eccentric individuals with the goal of telling stories in the form that best suited us. I shared some of my stories with him—I always used story telling as a way to relate to people—and he commented that some of them sounded like Raymond Carver’s work. I’m still working on those stories, I’m a slow learner, but I do think that in a small but important way talking to Berman made me see that if they were important to me they might be important to others. In the interview that follows Berman talks about music and writing—more so about writing, which is why I think this particular interview is a departure from the norm—and I hope his warmth and unpretentious gentility comes across because to a 19 year old girl from New York City he was a perfect gentleman. Now read the interview."

  "title": "Berman Untangles New Silver Jews Album",
  "body": "By Jonathan Cohen for Billboard.com. Breaking the longest musical silence of his decade-plus career, David Berman has reactivated his Silver Jews project for its fifth studio album, \"Tanglewood Numbers.\" Due Oct. 18 via Drag City, the 10-track set boasts the return of longtime collaborators/former Pavement members Stephen Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich, who took a breather from the Jews' 2001 album, \"Bright Flight.\" \"For the first time, I really am happy with the record in the sense that I will listen to it without it being a painful experience,\" Berman tells Billboard.com from his Nashville hometown. \"In my mind, this is a hard rock record. The last one was more of a vocal record. With my limited voice, my reaction to displaying it is that it's necessary to put it right out front and not to hide it. But on this record, it's a rock record, so I thought the voice would become more of an instrument.\" \"Tanglewood Blues\" will hardly earn comparisons to Black Sabbath or Ozzy Osbourne (of whom Berman confesses a recent obsession, along with Johnny Paycheck), it does feature a handful of more propulsive tracks than usual, including opener \"Punks in the Beerlight\" and the frothy, lyrically beguiling \"Sometimes a Pony Gets Depressed.\" What it mostly offers up is another helping of literate, country-tinged rockers (\"Animal Shapes,\" \"K-Hole\") and maudlin ballads (\"The Farmer's Hotel,\" the first three minutes of \"There Is a Place\"). A major new contributor is Berman's wife Cassie, who offers effective vocal counterpoint on a number of cuts and inspired the artist to fill \"20 of those little yellow legal pads\" with ideas. Malkmus plays guitar on every song, while other contributions were turned in by Drag City labelmate Will Oldham, former A Perfect Circle/Papa M member Paz Lenchantin, former Jesus Lizard guitarist Duane Denison and keyboardist Tony Crow. But \"Tanglewood Blues\" nearly got the better of Berman, who wrestled control of the project from engineer Mark Nevers just as it was ready to be mixed, following a dispute over its musical direction. At one point, Berman says Nevers even threatened to throw the master tapes into the Cumberland River. Cooler heads eventually prevailed (Nevers and Berman remained friends), and the mix was completed by Joe Funderburk, a Nashville veteran of albums by the Judds and Glen Campbell. \"He's just a really, really peculiar fellow,\" Berman says of Funderburk. \"His house has goat skulls on the walls. I was really frightened to go there and do things. I didn't know Joe and I didn't want to hang out in a haunted house all day. But it turned out great.\" In fact, Berman is so pleased with the finished product that the notoriously stage-shy artist seems more likely than ever to support it with live shows at some point in 2006. Estimating that he's performed \"about 12\" times in his career, Berman acknowledges, \"My attitude about performance is more mercenary now. \"Before, it was something I really felt couldn't be successful and shouldn't be done,\" he continues. \"I wasn't in the business of peddling music and going out and selling myself. I want to go make a record and then return to my own life. But it has gotten the point where I can't afford to just make money off records. I'm so far in debt from hospital bills over the last few years and just not working, that I can't afford to be so protective of my art anymore. I refused to be an entertainer, but I guess I'm open to the idea of seeing if I can be an entertainer.\" But Berman points out that touring could also offer the added benefit of extra time spent with his wife. \"I was thinking, why not have Cassie's voice be the second voice instead of Malkmus' voice? I can't be sure that if I ever want to play live that Malkmus can even be there, but I know Cassie can,\" he says. \"If I want to play some shows in 2006, bringing my wife is like the best idea in the world.\" Also on the horizon for Berman: the follow-up to his 1999 novel \"Actual Air\" (\"I need a six-month stretch where I say, 'just this' [before beginning work on it],\" he offers) and a collection of early, previously unreleased Silver Jews material. \"I have hundreds of tapes of me, Bob and [Malkmus], but I've been real reluctant to go through them,\" he admits. \"Each one is 45 minutes long and we would just kind of let the thing run and make up songs for that night. It's like the Library of Congress.\""

  "title": "Pitchfork Interview from January, 2002",
  "body": "by Mark Richard-SanTaken from Pitchfork Media.Silver Jews started when David Berman began playing with Steve Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich in the late 80s at the University of Virginia. Early singles with Drag City were noisy and lo-fi, very much in step with the indie rock of the early 90s. With each new album, Berman simplified his approach and refined his writing technique, adopting a progressively countrified sound to complement his always witty and insightful lyrics. Sometimes Malkmus, Nastanovich or Steve West showed up for a record, and sometimes they didn't, but over time the erroneous assumption that Silver Jews were a \"Pavement side project\" faded. Meanwhile, Berman continued to pursue writing apart from music. The Baffler was wise enough to run his terrifically accomplished poetry regularly through the mid-90s, and he later placed his work with the highly regarded Open City. A book of poetry on Open City's publishing imprint made some waves in 1999, and he contributed an entertaining essay about high school and ecstasy to Feed Magazine. Gore Vidal said of writer Italo Calvino, \"Reading [him], I had the unnerving sense that I was also writing what he had written; thus does his art prove his case as writer and reader become One.\" This is something like the sensation I get from listening to the Silver Jews. David Berman's writing, both with his music and in his poetry, has an uncanny ability to outline and map the blurry edges of consciousness. The following email interview took place in January. Pitchfork: Bright Flight strikes me as a bit closer to country than your other records. In \"Tennessee,\" the narrator fantasizes about moving to Nashville, writing sad songs and getting paid by the tear. I've noticed you have an affinity for a witty couplet that also says something sad, something Nashville songwriters have long been interested in. Do you feel a kinship with the country songwriting tradition? Any particular favorites among country songwriters? How about a favorite turn of phrase? Berman: Lyrically, country music is the most satisfying music for me. Even a cheap shot like Garth's \"Friends in Low Places\" is fascinating, like a hovering cube above my bed. It has a lot to do with concision and details that spread a fabric under the song. Bobby Braddock is great. Of course Bill Anderson. Roger Miller for weirdness. Some favorite titles: \"I'm Gonna Hire a Wino to Redecorate Our Home,\" a hit for David Frizzell in the early eighties, \"I Got in at 3 with a 10 and Woke Up at 10 with a 3\" is another. I just crack up when I hear the Bellamy Brothers' \"If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body (Would You Hold It Against Me).\" So damn gay it's hilarious. Pitchfork: Like most of us, the narrator of \"Friday Night Feeling\" loves the sound of a jukebox playing. What ten records would we find in your ultimate bar jukebox? Berman: Dinosaur Jr. - You're Living All Over MeRolling Stones - Beggars BanquetNew Order - Greatest HitsBob Wills - Last Time AroundRoyal Trux - Sweet SixteenThe Pogues - Rum Sodomy & The LashButthole Surfers - Hairway To StevenMercury Rev - See You On The Other SideCharlie Rich - Behind Closed DoorsJimmy Martin - You Don't Know My Mind Pitchfork: \"I Remember Me\" is one of my favorite songs on Bright Flight. It seems like a new kind of song for you, one with a very clear and direct narrative. Did you approach the writing of this song any differently? What role do you feel narrative plays in your writing in general? Berman: I always have wanted to sustain stories over the length of a song but haven't tried much because I figured it's someone else's turf. I mean, when you're writing songs you play to your strong side, and mine had always been fractured, however slightly, composition. I had been keeping off asking this woman I love to marry me for a handful of years. I knew I was going to eventually, but was happy to think of it always as 9 months off, when I had a little more money or something. For that song, I imagined I had the chance to ask taken away from me through the insertion of a runaway truck. Pitchfork: Do you have an interest in politics? Do you feel like political matters inform your songwriting? Berman: Probably insofar as I have a sometimes angry relationship with an abstract enemy called \"rich people\" that's been going on since I was a kid. It's a long story. It comes out in the songs. I think in \"We Are Real\" off the last album which is political in a pure sense, Us vs. The Forces That Lie To Us. Pitchfork: Silver Jews albums typically have one instrumental (my favorite is \"Night Society\"). What's the idea behind putting an instrumental on a record? Do you listen to much instrumental music yourself? What are some favorites? Berman: I always say they are put there as respite from the words and/or my voice (which doesn't agree with everyone to say the least) and I guess that's so. By now also it's just the way I order the records. They are all organized the exact same way, more or less. I'm a big fan of John Oswald's Grayfolded CD, which is 150 minutes of [the Grateful Dead's] Darkstar instrumental passages, hundreds of live versions laid on top of each other, twisted and manipulated. Pitchfork: Your writing is filled with place names, and it seems like you've moved around a fair amount. What are some of your favorite places for living and why? Berman: I don't think I've ever liked living in a city as much as I like Nashville now. The thing is you can't just pick a city, you have to pick a time too. NYC in 1989 was wildly different than NYC 1999. Austin was great in the 80s for me, but those same great qualities in a town draw people until \"it's just not the same anymore.\" Pitchfork: When do you think that first kid said, \"Punk's not dead, punk's not dead?\" Berman: Punk as it will be historically defined ended in the eighties. There were several last stands. The first Mudhoney single could have been the last. You can't talk about stuff like this without sounding like a total asshole. Pitchfork: How often do you pick up your guitar? Berman: I go months, sometimes years without. I usually get set to write a new record in my mind then go at it every day for a few hours until the album's done. Pitchfork: In Germany, the word for \"pizza\" is \"pizza\" and the word for \"hat\" is \"hut.\" Hence, some of the citizenry believes there's a chain called \"Pizza Hat,\" a belief reinforced by the fact that the \"red roof\" logo for this pizza chain looks like a bright red cap. When I heard this, it seemed like something that could be a Silver Jews lyric. Do you ever work something you overhear into your writing? How much of your imagery is inspired by things you actually see? Berman: I get a lot of ideas from mistakes like that. Sometimes I turn the TV just below where you can hear it and write down what I think they might be saying by the mumbles and rhythms. I think Derrida proposed that the reason Hegel is so revered in Western philosophy must in some small part be related to the fact that his last name sounds like \"eagle\" in so many Western languages. Pitchfork: Another question about imagery: Did you actually see BB King on \"General Hospital?\" Berman: I came into the living room and a soap opera's credits were rolling. I could have sworn I saw his name roll by. It seemed so unlikely, so incongruous that it captured my imagination. I saw him as a heart attack patient or an entertainer at a nurse's birthday party. Whatever happened on the real show, it was then my intellectually property, \"I saw BB King on General Hospital,\" and I can say that with conviction. Pitchfork: Certain words and phrases appear and reappear in your work. For example, the term \"split-level ranch\" appears in at least two songs and one poem. What comes to mind for you with that specific image? Berman: Those houses with floors that were really only half floors. Half a staircase that you could leap from kitchen to den and land on your knees cause the carpet was so thick. It's just one of those phrases that hold a lot inside of them. Pitchfork: I'm consistently impressed by the haiku-like compression in your lyrics and poetry. I have this theory that a complex experience can be packed into just a few carefully chosen words and slipped under the door to the reader, who can then unpack the phrase and get the full experience of the writer on the other side. For example, the line, \"An anchor lets you see the river move,\" from \"How to Rent a Room.\" I've spent hours thinking about all the implications of that line, many of which I imagine occurred to you when you wrote it. What technique is involved in achieving such compression? Berman: First you have to write a lot of sentences. Then you've got to switch to the other side and become the reader. Be hard on yourself. Take out those things that don't advance the cause even if you're fond of them. Then again and again. Allen Ginsburg was wrong about a lot of things, but especially when he said, \"First thought, best thought.\" Pitchfork: A few years ago, you said you wanted to wait to publish your poetry until it could get sufficient distribution. You said you didn't want to publish in the literary equivalent of a Drag City, because you were afraid of your poetry being lost in the shuffle. Were you satisfied with the impact that Actual Air had? Where are you publishing your writing now? Berman: The book got around. The Open City people are well connected to say the least. I mean, a review of a small press book of poetry in GQ? They did a good job. Lately, I'm not publishing anything right now. I'm waiting for a new Me to show up in my mind. Pitchfork: When you worked as a security guard at the Whitney, did you ever have to wrestle anybody to the ground? What were your duties? Berman: We had walkie-talkies. But the head guard would get mad if you fooled around with them. You called code two if you had to go to the bathroom. Malkmus and I would call code twos at the same time and go get high in Central Park. There were millions of hijinx. The other guards were genuinely fascinating, each and every one. I think guarding knocks a screw lose eventually. All that thinking time. Pitchfork: Do you make a living from your writing and music? What's the worst job you ever had? What was so bad about it? Berman: The best way to describe it is, \"I get by.\" I probably make $23,000 a year. For a 35-year old that's not so hot, but my goal when I left college was not to have a boss. And I've met it for going on 7 years. Now it looks like those days may be over. But its always looked that way and then in the last minute a check from nowheresville moved the sentencing date forward. Like a $5,000 check from The Minus Times for my essay \"Why I Hate Movies.\" My worst job was working as an orderly in a hospital in Virginia that took in all the 800-lb. people from the mountains who had to be cut out of their log cabins. Took three men to turn them on their side so the nurses could change the sheets. I was heaving the ass up when this feller shit liquid green turds all over my hands and forearms. Smoking angel dust in the morgue was cool, though. Pitchfork: What's next for David Berman and the Silver Jews? Berman: I actually have no fucking idea."

  "title": "A New Shine",
  "body": "From Nashville Scene. By Heather NelsonSilver Jews tunesmith/poet moves to town Musicians are moving to Nashville all the time, and in seemingly greater numbers than ever before: Country singers and songwriters still come looking for a break, while college students have been increasingly attracted by MTSU's and Belmont's music-business programs, not to mention the relatively low cost of living. Musician and poet '''David Berman''' hardly fits either of those molds, but his recent relocation to Nashville only offers further proof of the growth and diversity of the city's musical talent. For those unfamiliar with Berman's work, he's most commonly recognized as the man behind the Silver Jews, who've released several records on the Chicago-based indie Drag City Records (home to Jim O'Rourke, Palace, and Royal Trux, among others). Berman writes all of the Silver Jews' material and employs an ever-changing cast of musicians; the only regular is Pavement's Steve Malkmus, who has played guitar on two of the band's three full-length albums. On his latest release, American Water, Berman couches his observant, painfully honest lyrics in sparse, stoned rock melodies and a lazy country drawl. The real meat of the Silver Jews, in fact, is Berman's lyrics. While his unflinching gaze doesn't edit out the uncomfortable realities from the beautiful revelations, he is a humorous, playful, and sometimes odd tunesmith. \"You have to trust a singer,\" he explains, \"and I don't trust a singer who isn't brave enough to live in the times no matter how ugly they may be. A fetishization of misery, however, would make a song unsingable to me.\" In \"We Are Real,\" Berman sings, \"Is it the problem that we can't see, or is it that the problem is beautiful to me?/Won't soul music change, now that our souls have turned strange/Repair is the dream of the broken thing/All my favorite singers couldn't sing.\" Appropriately enough for a singer so focused on lyrics, Berman recently released his first book of poetry, Actual Air, published by Open City Press. But unlike Jewel or Jim Morrison, who have released books of so-called poetry that even fans find questionable at best, Berman betrays true skill as a poet. The same voice found in Berman's lyrics weaves together the tales in Actual Air, but the poetry clearly has been crafted with much more precision and eloquence. Though you might expect an indie rocker's poetry to possess more whining and cynicism than gentle literary intelligence, Berman communicates with an air of effortlessness and hope. With one sentence, he establishes a mood in \"Snow\": \"When it's snowing, the outdoors seem like a room.\" And in \"The New Idea,\" he includes this beautifully accurate description: \"Due to its dense history of uncomfortable moments, our elevator is haunted with poorly conceived smiles and sinking hearts, so I take the stairs/I suppose it's difficult to work with people who are comfortable inside of nightmares, though even the numbest of us are intimidated by the unnatural bulk of `his' life story.\" When asked how much he will participate in the Nashville music scene, Berman explains that he rarely plays live; he has only performed 10 to 15 times since the Silver Jews' debut in 1994. \"There are studio musicians, people who just write, [and] people who just play live,\" he states, \"and I'll take two of those three. It's funny that musicians are the only artists asked to go on the road and sell their work. To me, that's what touring is, selling a record.\" Conversely, Berman does poetry readings fairly often, and he intends to do some here. He also says he may record the album he's currently writing in a Nashville studio. Of local bands, he cites the Brian Kotzur Band as his favorite. \"One thing that cracks me up in the Nashville local music scene,\" he laughs, \"is this verbal battle between Music Row and alt-country. Alternative country, to me, is just as ridiculously empty in a different way - it's just that they're not in power. All these people singing about a life they never knew - it's really a fetishization of Depression-era country life. If authenticity is the issue, then there's something more authentic to me about Wal-Mart country, which speaks to the real needs or lives of people who listen more than talking about grain whiskey stills.\" It's not surprising that a musician who melds poetic rock with a country-based aesthetic would move to Nashville. For the Virginia-born Berman, however, this music- and now football-centric town stands out as a welcome change from his eight-month stay in Louisville, Ky., where his girlfriend was finishing college. \"I really hated Louisville,\" he admits. \"There's a dark sorrow over that city. We like it here a lot - there's an optimism in the air when a town is growing - but really we just moved down the highway.\""

  "title": "These are Special Times - from Sound Collector Issue 3",
  "body": "Starring David Berman of the Silver JewsBy Brendan NewnamDavid Berman is a writer who writes songs. On top of a gesso of indie-rock/country music Berman applies layers of snapshots and postcard messages creating portraits as distorted and accurate as convenience store mirrors. He manages to incite laughter, melancholy, and philosophical introspection through his quirky observations and keen linguistic manipulation. As an antidote to the recent swell of instrumental, ambient music, Berman's songs are about words, chameleon-like, perfectly rendered words. '''Why do you write songs?'''I think if you really get down to the nitty gritty on why I write songs or anyone does, it's pretty ugly. It probably has to do with wanting to be loved or desired for power, stuff like that. What's a nicer answer is I don't believe I do it for myself. In other words I don't believe if I lived on a desert island that I would compose songs. I would maybe play the guitar to see how it sounds and stuff but when you take the exercise all the way to creating a song which is supposed to endure even when you're not around, it's obviously something you want to make its way to other people. So it has to do with your relationship to the world, i.e. other people. So I'm obviously giving something and asking for something. '''But you don't feel the need to do this live. Touring doesn't figure into this exchange.'''Right. Well. I haven't been able to, number one, find a way in which I was adding anything by playing. I feel like 99% of what the songs are and will ever be in their definitive form is what happens when they're recorded. And I've certainly seen bands where I feel like something was added to the music or I was given a new look at the music but all too often and I would suspect my live show to fall into this category, it just seems like it's not even a reinterpretation of the songs, it's just basically hearing the songs, maybe not even in their best form and then being able to see the people as they're doing it. Which isn't enough of a justification for me to disrupt the rhythms in my life by going on tour and it also doesn't seem enough justification to ask people to pay money. I mean I'm real conscious of the fact of what you're asking people to do. And I don't feel at this point I'm asking people to do much. If someone has listened to the records before and they like them and they want to continue and see where the project is going, they are welcome to. I do feel that a lot of times that after someone had paid fifteen dollars or ten dollars for your CD, of the hard earned money that they've worked for and then you ask them to come and give you ten more dollars, and you're not giving them anything additional, I just don't feel comfortable with it. And I know it's the personal choice of the fan and they obviously want it or think they want it but I sometimes feel like its just sort of a procedure people go through. I mean, as many times people ask why I don't play live like other musicians and all. What I often might say is why don't you answer the question, why do you play live and so many people can't really tell you. They say 'well you just do it you're supposed to, it's the thing that's supposed to be done.' '''What rhythms of your life would be disrupted by touring? What do you do when you're not recording music? I know you travel around a lot and occasionally write for the Minus Times and the Baffler.'''I move around a lot lately especially but mostly it's just a lot of wasted time sitting around staring. A lot of wasted time, I probably sleep too much. It's upsetting to me I'm not proud of it but I have an unlimited capacity for sleep. It just seemed like it's happened in the last couple of years. Sometimes I'll sleep for like four days maybe, I'll get up for an hour and then go lie down again and get up for an hour twelve hours later and that will go on for like four days. I don't really know why it happens and I've even gone to the doctor to see what's wrong. I spend a lot of time… I don't think I workout any problems in my sleep I have some of my most… a lot of clarity. It's like with the touring question, I'm very protective of my time but I can't say an outside party, if they could see what I do with my time, would see it as generative, but it somehow is, cause when I set myself to working I feel like I'm drawing on a lot of placidity or whatever I build up. '''Your writing is often fragmented and anecdotal. Is that how you go through life or how you perceive other people as going through their lives?'''Well, its hard to say I think people think more that way then they have in their past and I think that it would be hard to understand the mental patterns we'll have if things go the way they are now it will be hard for us to understand how fractured our thinking can be. And it's always a gambit, the way I write or the way others write if it seems fragmentary it may appear plain and forthright in the future I don't know. The reception of John Ashberry's writing is much different then it is today. There is something to be said for the fact that there is a lot more channel changing going on in people's brains. I don't think it's something that… I don't know why I do it, I don't think like that, but I don't really think that when anyone writes they are making a true mirror of how they think I think its more of an idealized form of how they think. So it's a tendency and a shadow of how I might think. '''Why not write it in some other form other than music?'''There's going to be a book, that should have been out by now but it's been slowed down mostly because of me fiddling with it but it's supposed to come out. I don't think I would ever treat a book like an album, I would keep them very separate. Like when this book comes out it's a book of fifty-five poems, and I would never release it on Drag City. I would never do that. I want to keep them separate. I don't want it to be like a musician's book. I want to keep them separate like on the book it doesn't say anything about the Silver Jews in the liner notes. '''Who do you want to read it?'''I think I'd want it to be as many different kinds of people as possible. It's excited to me that yes some people who just listen to music might be reading this book of poems and it might be the first book of poetry they have picked up voluntarily in their whole life. But on the other hand I'd like also people whose main interest is poetry and who know about the predecessors and come from the complete opposite direction. '''It seems to me that many people whose main interest is music, get from your music what they used to get from literature.'''Well people don't read much anymore, that's true. Yeah, it's a basic fact, if I'm taking advantage of that, I probably am, I mean I think a lot of people ... well there is something that is just sort of irresistible about the fact that in pop music or rock music or folk music, that content wise the territory has been so unexplored. So if you have a want to do so there is plenty to write about. There just aren't that many examples of people who really want to push it. Not only is it too crowded out there for that, and it's also exciting, I mean I never understand when people talk about the ending of things. The end of the novel, of the end of rock music and stuff like that, I always sort of feel whether through crossbreeding or whatever, there's still a million things to do. '''Your lyrics often seem audio-voyeuristic, meaning they seem like they've been written by listening instead of watching. Is this the case and if so is it a perversion?'''Am I the audio-voyeur? Well, I think that's sensory confusion. Yes there is some voyeuristic tendencies to the writing but I'm seeing what I'm writing and not hearing it. It's only when it gets to you that it's an auditory experience. I'm seeing all the pictures pretty clearly the way I envision them and I don't even hear myself transmitting it really until it's all done. As far as it being a perversion? That's a tough question. You could say that all writing is a perversion in the sense that, why with so much life around you and this world around you, do you feel the need to create a parallel or subworld. And if it's a perversion, it's kind of like a power thing a genesis thing, not the band. It's creation but probably the way I do it is knitting little shards from life, so probably I am taking. '''Do you like Aerosmith and if so why?'''That's a good question. I have a funny relationship with Aerosmith. I don't like them as much as I feel like I should There is a certain category of bands that don't turn me in but I don't blame the band, I think it's something missing in me. I kind of like the eighties ballads or the late eighties ballads they had in their come back. I was never a big fan. It's stuff like, Walk This Way and their big radio hits that are kind of overplayed so when I turn them on I can't hear them. I can just hear my experience of the song. You know how there is that certain category of song like certain Beatles songs and Respect by Aretha Franklin or Satisfaction that when you hear them you can't hear them anymore. Part of my problem with Aerosmith is that I could never figure out if they were really dark or not, and I like to know that about a band. I like bands that are dark and I like bands that aren't and I could never figure out if they were. (Discussion about sadness and television, Charlie Rose's penchant for lascivious answering machine messages, brutality and Jerry Springer) removed by editor. '''Back to the TV thing. \"I saw BB King on General Hospital\" is one of my favorite lines of yours.'''Yeah! That's one of my favorites too. And that line to me, although very funny, makes me really sad and makes me think about why BB King had to be there and where was your narrator when he watched it. TV in the daytime, there is something so sad about that. My mom is right now watching something real sad. It's Celine Dion's special \"These are Special Times\" the Thanksgiving special. And I was trying to explain to her tonight why I hate Celine Dion but I didn't get anywhere. I just have to give up trying to make her understand. Her favorite musicians are Celine Dion, Michael Bolton, and Yanni and I was trying to explain to her what was wrong and I got caught. I've been driving her car all week and there was this cassette with some piano music and I really liked it. I thought it was real nice and I popped it out and nothing was written on it so I just kept listening to it. It was real pretty and eventually I asked her what it was and she told me it was Yanni. I wasn't embarrassed that I liked it because I just had to take it as empirical fact, but I was embarrassed that I wouldn't listen to it after that. I was ashamed of myself that I wouldn't let myself listen to something I liked knowing it was Yanni. '''Sure, the cultural hang-ups.'''It's pathetic. '''Would you want a Thanksgiving Special? Are you comfortable with your status on the cultural radar would you prefer to be a larger blip or a smaller blip? Or are you not a blip at all?'''Well everybody's a blip so I'll say I'm a blip. '''Do you want to be on MTV?'''Well I've never wanted to make a video and you have to do that first and I hate MTV and consider it almost satanic, but I'll tell you I have another thing I feel guilty about. About two weeks ago on MTV news as they were going to commercial, they flashed up some records that had just been released. They flashed up R Kelly for a few seconds then the Silver Jews and then the George Michael record. I was really mad at myself because I got off on it. '''That's to be expected.'''I should be truer to my beliefs. '''What song?''' \"Smith and Jones\" '''Is that your single?'''No. There is only a single in England, but I have to tell you after a few recordings I thought we finally got out records to sound really produced and that we were studio savvy but you could really hear the drop off from the R Kelly song to the Silver Jews song and back to the George Michael song. It really put it all in perspective for me."

  "title": "Silver Jews Leader Delivers Poetic Contradictions With 'Actual Air' - from Sonic",
  "body": "Silver Jews Leader Delivers Poetic Contradictions With 'Actual Air'by Chris NelsonSinger/songwriter David Berman reads from poetry collection at Chicago bookstore, talks shop.CHICAGO - Silver Jews leader David Berman, in town to give a poetry reading, sat straight-backed in the tiny Chinese eatery with nothing before him but a Corona that he had poured into a juice glass.It was an odd juxtaposition - not only the beer in the juice glass, but the Mexican beer in an Asian restaurant.But then, Berman lives and breathes such contradictions - at least in his poetry.\"I think the real unit of a poem is phrases,\" said Berman, the singer, songwriter and guitarist whose first book of poetry, \"Actual Air,\" was published in June. \"Most specifically, a noun modified by an adjective that you've never seen it modified with before.\" Fans of Berman's will recognize one such phrase in the Silver Jews' album title American Water. That 1998 disc included such songs as \"Blue Arrangements\" and \"Random Rules\".\"Once I was in school and a teacher said, 'There aren't any interesting verbs in [this poem]. You always seek interesting object descriptions, but I guess you're not interested in describing action in a new way,' \" Berman, 32, recalled in a deep, gentle voice.\"My poems are like miniatures. They're real still. There's not left hooks and speeding trains and stuff. They always seem boxed in.\"That stillness pervades \"Actual Air\" even more thoroughly than Berman's work with Silver Jews, a band whose revolving membership often includes Pavement singer Steve Malkmus. Snowfall sets the scene in several of the poems. \"When it's snowing, the outdoors seem like a room,\" Berman writes in the opening piece, \"Snow.\" He maintains the intimacy but turns the image inside out in \"If There Was a Book About This Hallway,\" referring to a favorite passageway as \"an outdoors that is somehow indoors.\"\"The Spine of the Snowman\" plays again with incongruities, as an old caretaker explains to a robot that when snowmen melt, they sometimes reveal inner constructions, such as a gourd for an organ or a stick for a spine.\"The robot shifted uncomfortably in his chair,\" Berman writes, striking the reader with the disconcerting notion that some things are so odd as to make even a heartless being squirm.During his 20-minute poetry reading at Barbara's Bookstore in the Old Town neighborhood, Berman's six-foot-three-inch frame loomed tall under a neon sign for the \"Kid's Books\" section. He explained that references to middlebrow authors Isaac Asimov and James Michener in several of his poems are not meant as irony.\"You get it wrong if you think it's a joke - about so many things,\" he told the audience of about 40 fans.Earlier, smoking a cigarette outside the store, Berman said Silver Jews' three albums had provided enough income to subsidize a non-lucrative poetry career. He isn't generally paid for readings such as this one, and he had to foot the airfare from his home in Nashville.Perhaps that's why he looked unceremonious in an army-surplus shirt, with a five-o'clock shadow and unwashed, barely combed hair. Might as well be comfortable for a gig that's not even paying.Songwriting is not only more profitable but also typically easier than writing poetry, said Berman, who studied poetry at the University of Massachusetts. \"If I write a song, I usually start out with the music and then write words to fit into those cadences. I can go anywhere when I sit down with a blank piece of paper [to write a poem]. But the flip side of that freedom is there's a lot more pressure. The limits of songwriting are actually very helpful.\"Joe Williams, a 21-year-old fan, was first drawn to Berman's work through Silver Jews' albums. He bought \"Actual Air\" when it was first published in June and drove six hours on Thursday from Ames, Iowa, to hear Berman read.\"It's kind of like audience-participation poetry, where you know what he means,\" Williams said. \"In my own mind, there's no doubt that I know what he's saying or I know what he's trying to convey. It makes it stick with you that much more. A lot of what he's saying is relatable and straightforward enough that you really walk away feeling like he told you something.\""

  "title": "Past the Blues",
  "body": "Past the Blues - An Interview with David BermanDusted's Ben Tausig speaks with Silver Jews founding father David Berman. David Berman, Woody Allen of the Other America! Last week in NYC, he and Will Oldham acted in the Berman-penned short “Publicity Stunt,” in which Berman lay on the couch as psychologist Oldham probed. Funny and clever, but with a curious finale: Berman trotted out a Scottish singer-songwriter who’d handed him a killer demo, and made us listen. It wasn’t horrible. There wasn’t much to say.The incongruity of the event was an apt metaphor for the history of the Silver Jews, who were once quite touching. Tanglewood Numbers, their new album, isn’t horrible. There isn’t much to say. As ever, Berman delivers charmingly disjointed lyrics, but now he writes caricatured rock songs as if he’s trying to sell - rather than say - something. (A style? An anti-style? I give up.)In any case, here’s Berman on Tennessee and the Torah.Dusted: Increasingly, the Silver Jews rock out - why this direction?DCB: The same reason an aging man tries to look healthy in a singles bar. He wears that certain sweater. The brown one. Ten years ago I didn't rock out much because there was a lot of rocking going on and I didn't perceive a place where I could contribute. Today bands live inside something called Rockworld. A perfectly safe and fully regulated arena with roped off seating for Mom and Dad. The chicks are hot, the players are good looking and the audience gets laid. Dead bands built Rockworld in the seventies and eighties. Today's stylish rockchilde has inherited the infrastructure and furnishings but instead of building on spends most of his time in \"Joe Cocker's Bathroom.\" Kings of Leon and the Killers should pay estate taxes just to exist. All of this creates the illusion that I'm really rocking out when I'm just kind of rocking out by any other era's standard.Dusted: Which bands rocked you into a corner in the 90's?DCB: How about such names as US Maple, Alice in Chains and Cherry Poppin’ Daddies? By the way I'm refusing to observe Kurt Cobain's Death Day until it's publicly noted that a lead singer by the name of Layne Staley died that day too. It really is bullshit. It's like how Time/Life and their ilk have condensed the sixties down to two three maybe four images, that are rolled across the screen whenever that fabled decade’s name is ground out. Commercial History pushes the uncategorical out of the way. (Why is Jimmy Martin not in the Country Music Hall of Fame? Who were the jackasses at Rolling Stone who didn't write about Big Star in 1973? Who drove Pauly Shore's career underground again? I want their names.) Now how does Staley/Cobain Day sound to everyone?Dusted: For a band that hasn't done much touring, collaborating, or interviewing, that's distanced itself in general, it's surprising to hear that you concern yourself with trends. Or isn't it? Have the Silver Jews always had a punk ethos?DCB: It is surprising for you but I am very conscious of trends. I attend to trivialities like any college educated 21st century significance nexus. It is some of the flashy fruit we pick from the bushes at the oft-surveyed edge of modern consciousness.Dusted: Four long years since the last album; what have you been listening to/reading since?DCB: I hardly read fiction anymore. Likewise, I don't watch movies. I've been less comfortable taking leave of the world. I read a couple of newspapers every day. I listen to the music on WSM 650 AM when I listen to music. I read the Torah every day. For most of my adulthoodDCB: I'd been the governor of an inward state, and that just seems morally reprehensible at this particular roadside taco stand in history.Dusted: You read the Torah in Hebrew?DCB: I wish. Unfortunately I could never learn another language anytime I tried. I couldn't even get a foothold anywhere. French was a bottomless hole and I never hit. Spanish was fortified by high spikey iron fences. I am trapped in the fields and low hills of English.Dusted: Is fiction escapism? Is plugging in to the newsstream better? Of what you've read/heard, what has most affected your songwriting and arrangements?DCB: After fiction has taught a human how to empathize (only one of its many excellencies and functions) with other members of its species, its benefits become maintenance operations, unwisely carried out when time is so dear and the enemy is so near.There is a set of books by Flann O'Brien on Dalkey Archive Press I really love. They are the collected clippings from the Irish Times, of a column he wrote under the name Myles NaCopaleen (spelling wrong here, I am not near a copy) and titled Cruiskeen Lawn. Excellent if you are looking for a model of levity that accepts future suffering as a permanent fact.Late Roger Miller. The Darkness album is pure joy to me. I liked the sound of some April Wine, UFO, Scorpions records I buy. I was impressed with the Fiery Furnaces’ urgency. I like the way they push their message. I was really inspired by Bobby Braddock’s early eighties production work. I re-bought some old records I hadn't heard in a while and listened to them with completely new ears.the fall - this nation's saving grace\\husker du - new day risin\\x - more fun in the new worldJust those three with their outward lookingness inspire in ways that contemporary rockbands, circumscribed by the history of rock, are unable to do. It's like mirrored jeans. Rock music can't solve the problems of Rock on the level of Rock.As long as rock music feeds on rock history it will be unable to draw lessons from it. The young lion gorging on the stomach of a zebra does not see the complicated architecture of the three-stomach digestive system that it's tearing apart. There are many talented mimics who are able to instinctually channel style from the past. I actually think there is some promise to the Kings of Leon and expect them to outlast bisexual-baiting and -gay-male rock-critic-cock-teasing group like Franz Ferdinand.Also, and I'm not going for a laugh here, I totally understand and love the way Mutt Lange and Shania Twain’s greatest hits sound.Dusted: Your new album refers to places in TN, NY, MD, and MS, at least; indeed, geographic references, particularly to the American Southeast, are a Silver Jews staple. Discuss?DCB: As a kid I was always frustrated when a story was set in an imaginary place. I find soap operas intolerable because of their phony town names. Plausible details are scene setting to me. I don't have any real geographical allegiances.That's just my preference as a reader/listener. For it to be given that the setting is a place. For this reason I am poisoned by the attempts to idealize land. It's the problem in the Middle East, same as it's the problem in music row studios.Dusted: How will the Southeast change after the flood(s)?DCB: I don't see the southeast as a region with any significant cultural differences in historical terms. Is an accent and a tendency to eat cheese grits enough to delineate a people? By what they call soda? No. Southerners play up their accents when you walk in the room and it's all phony baloney. Everybody watched Headbangers Ball and ate at McDonalds just the same. In the 1970's Walker Percy couldn't find any significant difference in the regions. All that's left is a bunch of cliches. It's all so consciously done. Spreading out the 5 or 6 signifiers over an entire weekend and you can have yourself a real fine time down in spooky old Dixie!As of this morning 75% of Republicans approve of Bush's handling of the flood. I thought more of these people would been woken up by seeing what no one seems to be able to [tell] them about their president. More than Bush it is Bush-voters who are the problem. The most dangerous voting bloc in American history. People need to start talking about politics at the dinner table again. At Thanksgiving. With cousins and aunts who maybe have all their news filtered by someone in their house. Americans need to have access to correct information in order to govern themselves.Dusted: C'mon. Beyond cliches, there must be something about the South that's appealing, distinct. You're forever singing about it – only because you've lived there?DCB: It would be ridiculous for anyone to make that argument. This world is fascinating in all its aspects. But when I'm in Hohenwald Tenn., I’m not in Dixie, I’m in an elephant sanctuary. My point is \"moonlight and magnolias, and cicadas, and the wounded mystery is bs personal marketing by people without individual identity. If your writing \"southern fiction\" right now you better be the author of Tim Franklin's first book, or you don't have a chance. They’re notmaking masterpieces in Oxford Mississippi nowadays. It's like the rockmusic. Self-referential to a disqualifying for masterpiece level level. It's why altho I like their songs individually, the Drive-By Truckers won't write an album more penetrating of Southernism than the film Driving Miss Daisy did with the same task. If your an artist isn't time to get universal. I don't have time for sightseeing right now. These are the phases in history when a person is morally obligated to read a good newspaper every day.Dusted: Also, really? Are you saying that McDonalds and MTV erase the cultural faultlines created by segregation, the civil rights movement, backbreaking poverty?DCB: No I'm saying that white guys from the suburbs of Atlanta have a million times more in common with white guys from the suburbs of Pittsburgh, than they do with sharecroppers or planters.Dusted: How and why did you choose a William Eggleston photo for the cover? Do you know the Egglestons personally? Did you know: his pictures have also been on the covers of Big Star's Radio City, Primal Scream's Give Out But Don't Give Up, and Chuck Prophet's Age of Miracles, possibly among others? Does that make you a hack?DCB: His son Winston and I are friends. I've never met Mr. Eggleston. Winston let me in to the archives and said I could have my pick. That was too much.Yes I even looked through the other shots that were on these rolls. The house where the red ceiling was photographed has a blue ceilinged room just like it, with the same kind of white cord. What about the Green on Red album? Shouldn't you know about that? Who's hacking here?Dusted: Do you share an ethos? You and Eggleston speak about the South in such similar ways - through the eyes of a native; enamored of and amused by its color and colors.DCB: He is for admirers of the crumpled ice cream sandwich wrapper in the mud.He gets it down for us.Dusted: The album refers to many animals; at least, more than most albums. To wit: ponies, chickens, animal shapes and noises, brown birds, ducks, lions, shrews. Discuss? Do you live with animals?DCB: I have a conceptual band with my dog Miles (it has to be conceptual since I have to imagine Miles lyrics as well as my own, called \"woodchilde masquerade\". One of our numbers we do for Cassie is a little showstopper called \"that's Agri-tainment\". About the amusements of farm life:Spoken-word middle part from \"that's agri-tainment\":”I was driving down the road the other night when I nearly hit a possum. I turned to my friend and said ‘I could have sworn that possum was wearing a black bowtie.’ He looked at his watch and said ‘of course, he's headed home from The Animal Awards.’\"Dusted: Judaism seeps into the album, lyrically, in places. If I'm not overreaching, discuss?Dusted: Did it seep in philosophically?DCB: In the last year I've started to think of myself as a Jew. I want the strength to weather life. Judaism can grant you that strength. And it's so old. So time-tested. It makes me very happy. And there is so much to read.Dusted: You and your wife Cassie sing, together, \"let's not kid ourselves, it gets really, really bad,\" but life, you sing unaccompanied, is \"sweeter than Jewish wine.\" What gives?DCB: The statements aren't in opposition to each other. In fact sweetness and badness are definitively interdependent.Dusted: What and how much did Cassie write/compose/advise/counsel/hector?DCB: Cassie wrote the music for “The Poor, the Fair and the Good.” I bounce ideas off her all the time, the riskiest ones, and get her reaction. She is also my sustainer, my ally, and love.Dusted: Same question about Will OldhamDCB: We don't talk about each other's music much. Will is a vitalist. He's always ready to dive off a cliff or eat a fruit you've never seen before."

  "title": "Poetic Groans and Musical Apprehensions",
  "body": "From All-Music. By Robert L. DoerschukThe fine line between poetry and music blurs in the ironic, apocalyptic work of David Berman's Silver Jews. His biggest concern is that people are too dumb to read and too tired to hear. Steven Wright and Larry David grew up to be writer/comedians. Their humor is deadpan and depressed. Each reports on the absurdities of urban life in a listless monotone. Both hide bits of glittering insight inside enigmatic, vaguely disturbing vignettes. Neither, however, plays a guitar or leads a band. That's why we have David Berman. As the founder and locus of the Silver Jews, the Virginia-bred bard creates a rare balance between word and sound. His music is understated, if not narcoleptic. The band - which consists largely of whoever can make it to the studio or the gig - sounds like it had just crawled out of bed. It strums and clunks at low volume, perhaps in order to follow Berman's mumbled vocals. Every now and then it stirs itself into an unconvincing crescendo, only to lose interest after a minute or two. This is perfect accompaniment for Berman's tunes. God forbid that anyone should rip a sizzling solo through, say, \"Random Rules,\" the opening cut on the latest Silver Jews album, American Water. Berman moans the opening line - \"In 1984 I was hospitalized for approaching perfection\" - as if stupefied by a migraine headache. The point here, as in all of Berman's songs, is the lyric. Playing his songs with blazing chops would be like framing a Rembrandt with neon lights. Berman's relationship with words goes back a long way. Born in 1967 in Williamsburg, the son of a restaurant executive, he felt vague literary aspirations at some point in his youth. These led him into higher education, from which he bailed at age 25 with an MFA in English from the University of Massachusetts. With two fellow refugees from academia, guitarist Steve Malkmus and drummer Bob Nastanovich, he recorded a few experimental pieces. Malkmus and Nastanovich were, at this same time, getting nibbles of label interest for their own band, Pavement - which made the Silver Jews' breakthrough that much more unexpected. \"There was no plan,\" Berman remembers. \"Drag City offered to put out Pavement's second seven-inch. Right about that same time Dan and Dan [Dan Osborn and Dan Koretzky, co-owners of the label] came down to meet Stephen. I was around, and kind of by accident they heard these tapes I had been making at home. I never had any ideas they were releasable, but they were interested; they wanted to put them out.\" Which they did in 1993, as an EP titled The Arizona Record. One thing led to another, and soon Berman was in the studio with Malkmus and Nastanovich, cutting the first Silver Jews album, Starlite Walker (1994). \"That, for me, is where the real band starts,\" he says. \"Everything before that seems like sketchbooks. The sketches were released before the work. Usually sketches are released after the main body of work, but our education was caught on tape and released before we actually put it into practice. Two years later, Starlite Walker was followed by a second Silver Jews full-length album, The Natural Bridge, with a fresh lineup of players. American Water, with yet another group of Jews and a guest shot from Steve Malkmus, followed. While all this was going on, Berman was pursuing a parallel career as a poet. His was a familiar voice in coffeehouse recitals around New York, and his works were published in high-cred literary magazines, including Open City and The Baffler. In July 1999, he published his own collection of poems, Actual Air (Open City Books, $12.95). The handiwork there is similar to what we've heard from the Silver Jews, with an awareness of trivial but revealing detail and a fondness for word juxtapositions that seem bizarre and first but make more sense the longer you chew over them. The similarities that bind Berman's prose and music work are as intriguing as the differences that separate them. We had this and more in mind when we spoke with Berman shortly after the release of his book. '''The Inaudible Groove''''''''At the very beginning, was music your main inspiration?'''''I don't know. I've thought back on that, but when I was a little kid, I wasn't really inspired by anything. I don't think you could look back even to when I was 14 and say, \"This person will do something in the arts.\" I wasn't that way. No one in my family had ever done anything in any kind of creative endeavor, especially not for a living. I wasn't a big music fan. I didn't necessarily read a lot. I was kind of like a blank slate. When I got inspired, I think it was more by personality: the people around me, people I worked with, my cousin. I was inspired by social behavior. Then music became talky; it got very social. '''''You didn't play music at all as a kid?'''''Well, I was a music fan. I had a guitar and I would make noise in the basement with my friends. But for the most part, what I like to do is to find blank spots on the map, where I don't think things have been worked out yet. At that point, I really hadn't found a place for anything I could do - especially when I was just making noise in the basement, because we don't need anyone else to make noise in the basement anymore. When I started putting words to songs, I never made any big claims for what I was doing, but I did realize that because it was so word-oriented, it seemed to fill a unique position. In fact, when we started doing songs, it was so lyrically based that we would record on electric guitars without amplifiers, just using them acoustically. The music was always a pedestal to the words. That's been changing over time; it's become more musical in the sense that now we have actual passages of music with no words, where for a long time the minute the song started there was singing, and when it ended there was singing, with no solos or anything. '''''Is the emphasis on the words the reason why textures are so dry on your records?'''''Yeah. It's a conversational vibe. There's always cognizance of the fact that some day this will be for an audience. It's an implicit sort of an idea; it's not something that's ever phrased, that there won't be any production sleight-of-hand. It's just a way to have as few intermediaries between the instrument and the eventual output through the speaker in someone's house. The music tries to be non-deceptive; it gives some respect to the listener. Not that you can't put grandeur into music, but that's just not our strong point. We just do what we can do and try to be real. There's a real discipline to playing very quietly and building dynamics around the flow of words. How hard was it to get the band's latest incarnation to play within those limits? That happened pretty fast. We practiced for about a week before we started recording [American Water], three hours every day. I listened to some of the tapes from the practice. It's funny, because each song took about 10 different forms in the rehearsals. A lot of what turned out to be ballads on the record were faster originally, and \"Blue Arrangements,\" which is a rock song on the record, was more of a ballad. It was mainly contingent on the day we were playing things. I took that into the studio too. We were all keyed personally into each other. We got along very well, and we were partying a lot in and out of the studio. It wasn't a work situation; it was very organic and easygoing. There wasn't too much generaling going on; it was more biological, at the tempo we were feeling that day, at the pace of our own speech and the way our bodies felt. There was some fatigue going on, which for us translates into dynamics. An intellectual energy and a physical fatigue - I think we all felt that. '''''What's the key to sounding good at low volume?'''''Well, we all played live. Because we were playing a low volume, we didn't have to worry too much about bleeding over into each other. None of the vocals were live, of course. We never played more than three takes of a song. Sometimes we would play for 15 minutes because we were enjoying ourselves so much. A lot of the songs that have fadeouts imply the fact that it went on for a long time. It was funny; it was like playing when you know that what you're playing isn't practically useful. We would just keep playing because we were having fun, not because we knew that there was a part we were going to use 15 minutes into a song. It's just that no one wanted to stop. It's like college football versus pro football. '''''That's probably how the longest cut, \"Night Society,\" came about.'''''Yeah, that was at least half an hour long. '''''That was also the only track on American Water that lacked vocals. Were you trying to show that you guys could stretch out instrumentally?'''''Yeah. It's also a respite from all the words. I recognize that there's a barrage of language going on, so these instrumental breaks are to cleanse the palate. Also, we had a different band on this record, and it's a band I could trust to play their instruments, which hasn't always been true in the past. '''Inside American Water''' '''''Is it part of a conscious strategy to keep the sound of the Silver Jews as low-tech as possible?'''''I don't think it's conscious. It's more a kind of after-the-fact strategy, in the sense of, \"Well, we can get away with this stuff because that's what we built our music on all along.\" I don't want to call it laziness, but - and this might be a rationalization - when I was a kid, I can think of so many different songs where I would listen for the mistake. Whether it's on \"The Girl from the North Country,\" on Nashville Skyline [by Bob Dylan]. Or there's a Replacements song on Pleased to Meet Me where Paul Westerberg screams, \"What are you gonna do with your life?\" and Tommy [Stinson, bassist] says, \"Absolutely nothing!\" And you can hear Paul Westerberg laugh, and he drops his tambourine. There's lots of little mistakes like that, which I liked. That's charisma, that's personality. It's not scripted. There's enough music that's choreographed that, again, I can feel like it's a place where we can work and not too many people are working. '''''Did you record the guitar parts on American Water direct?'''''Some of the leads went direct, but mostly it was amplified. '''''What kind of guitar did you use for those open strummed rhythm parts?'''''That's a guitar that everybody I know makes fun of because it's such an '80s instrument. It's an Ibanez Lodestar 2. It's very tacky, but it's my main guitar. '''''It sounds like a hollow-body.'''''But it's not. It's a regular electric guitar. On some songs I would go over the rhythm track with an acoustic guitar, but we'd let 'em both be there together. '''''You use the rhythm guitar strum as a unifying device throughout American Water, but the drum part is constantly changing, even from one section of a song to the next.'''''That's out of necessity. I write these songs in a very simple way. I try to overcome the simplicity with variety on other levels, like the drums. Percussion on a lot of stuff like that is where we try to get a different coloring to what may be constant and stable, which is generally my tone of voice or the guitar. '''''Did you arrange those drum parts?'''''Tim [Barnes] came up with almost everything. Everybody pretty much came up with what they'd play. I would be corrective, in the sense that if I didn't like a part I'd say, \"Try something else.\" The way I instruct someone on how to play is, I'll illustrate a feeling. I'll be like, \"Play like you just got back from a tour of Vietnam.\" Then I'll tell a story. In introducing a song to the players in the first practices, I would tell them the story of the song and how I felt the band should be playing. It was more attitudinal instruction, as opposed to more pragmatic ideas. '''''So on a relatively acerbic track like \"Smith & Jones Forever,\" you'd ask the band to bring more of an edge to their performance.'''''Right. I might say, \"I want you to play with a certain amount of desperation to go along with the characters, but a kind of desperation whose end point is a kind of peace through exhaustion.\" The characters are exhausted people, so you want to play with an exhausted bite. The band needs to be perceptive enough to think in terms of mood and emotion. That's why it was important, when I saw the drummer, to read the vibe on his face, and his actual personality and attitude, and his receptiveness to ideas about charisma and things like that, as much as it was that he could actually play. '''''You hired Tim because of his vibe?'''''Oh, definitely. Personal contact had to be there. Just about a week before we started to practice, I went to a show in New York, and there was a band playing called Ethics Green. I really liked them, but I particularly liked Tim and his drumming, and I liked the smile on his face. I liked his vibe. I asked him to play, and he said yes. '''''In addition to altering the drum parts, you distinguish some songs on American Water by adding elements that nudge them one way or another - a trumpet and a flute on \"Random Rules,\" for example, and a Rhodes electric piano that kicks off \"Wild Kindness.\" How do you find the right effects to add?'''''That's based mainly on suggestion. After the basic tracks are done, we may go in with an idea of doing that, although going into \"Random Rules\" I didn't know what it would be. That's why I like to have a lot of people in the studio who can come up with ideas. I tell them, \"Listen, even if I say no 99 times in a row, I still want you to keep coming up with suggestions.\" A lot of those extra sounds were suggested by Mike [Fellows], the bass player. I would let him have free rein to come up with ideas. A lot of things didn't make it on: Each song might have had four or five overdubs, and maybe two or three would make it on. It was just a process of doing as much as possible with the time we had and worrying later about what we would leave in. '''''Was that scratch/wah-wah figure on \"People\" performed in the basic tracks?'''''That was afterwards. That song didn't have an instrumental ending in practice. This was another example of we enjoyed playing the song and we kept going. Then we were like, \"What can we do on the end here?\" I asked Steve [Malkmus], and he pulled out the wah-wah and played it, and it sounded good. That was also a case of me being interested in making a kind of dance song out of guitar, bass, and drums, without using any kind of keyboards, because I don't think that dance music inherently has to have that. This was as disco as we'd ever get. I was happy to do it with just the basic three. '''''\"Send in the Clouds\" has some cool backwards synth sounds.'''''Those were from two different keyboards that Mike used. I can't exactly remember what they were. That was just a breakdown part. It was like, \"Mike, we're going out for a beer. Put something in here.\" And he did. '''''On \"Like Like The The The Death\" several lines in each verse are delivered with a break in the rhythm, leaving just voice and single notes on guitar. Where did that idea come from?'''''That was a weird one. I wrote that song from three different parts that were glued together. The challenge was to make them cohere. In its initial writing, it was so broken, almost like language/poetry psychedelia, that I became interested in the stop/startedness of the song, and then the chorus seems by comparison to be soaring and broad and muscular. That was an experiment to see how far the song could stretch. It could stretch further because of its origin as a compound of different parts. '''''The only song on American Water that nods to another genre, as opposed to being intrinsic to your own style, is \"Honk If You're Lonely.\" You could peddle that number all over Nashville.''''' That was the idea. A lot of people have said, \"Is that a cover of something?\" It was a songwriting exercise on my part, to see if I could write something that sounded like a '60s country/honky-tonk standard. I have a very distinct idea about what I can do as a songwriter, but I also want to challenge myself to do other things. One of them was to write very simple lyrics and come up with something that could be almost like a standard. It's enough of a blank slate that it could have been anyone's song. It doesn't have a personal imprint. '''''How did you get the band into this less personal cut?'''''I just asked for a kind of celebration. The guy who's singing the song is obviously a lonely loser, but I didn't want it to be dejected at all. It's actually uplifting in some way. I wanted to make sure it wasn't just \"tears in your beer.\" In most songs, I try to find out as soon as possible what clichés it may be playing to, and then I write away from that. '''Vicious Idiocy''''''''Your emphasis on lyrics delivers a pretty clear hint to critics about how to approach what you're doing.'''''I guess, but I do feel like there's been a lot of back-handed praise or negative response to the Silver Jews. '''''What do you mean?'''''Well, you know, I was looking on the Internet the other day. I saw some reviews for Sidewalk.com - and they were essentially the same review from different cities. They started out, \"Try as you might to hate the Silver Jews, they're just too damn good to hate. . . .\" That kind of nailed it on the head: Why would anyone try to hate us from the beginning? There's a big strain of anti-intellectual sympathy in American pop culture. '''''If there's any bastion of pseudo-intellectual criticism in American pop culture, it's certainly in the realm of music journalism. You'd think these people would be thrilled.'''''Who knows? Maybe people attack what they hate about themselves. But I've been constantly surprised at a lot of these rock critics who like to dabble in extrapolating way out of context of what a music can be. When you open Spin, they're trying to make a case for Garbage being a really conceptual deal, with all of these intents and purposes and stuff like that. They're working so hard to make something out of nothing. So when they're given something where work can actually be put into it, as far as listening, there's some stubbornness and reluctance. I've always found that. Lately I've been more unapologetic about the fact that the culture is dumb. The last thing we need right now is more dumbness. There's nothing wrong with intelligence, even though there's this reverse snobbery in the magazine world. '''''Is this a question of the culture being dumb in general or of pop music appealing to a specifically dumb fragment of the culture?'''''There are different fragments of culture, but it seems like, if you find a fragment of the culture that's interested in thought and meaning, it's become commonplace to get your Dumb and Dumber kinds of things as entertainment. Comedy, especially, which a lot of people go for, has kind of come down to - with very few exceptions - laughing at people doing really dumb stuff. Sometimes I feel like you can measure what's going on in a culture by its comedy, and it seems like a lot of smart people, maybe because everything's going so well economically and there's no wars, just want to come home and laugh at people slipping on a banana peel. '''''People have always laughed at the misfortunes of others.'''''That's old, right. '''''But nowadays there's a judgmental aspect to that laughter: This guy deserves to slip on a banana peel because he's too fat, or he's a Republican, or whatever.'''''Yeah, for the most part it's been that way - The Jerk, Steve Martin, things like that. David Letterman added a lot to that: There's a lot of \"at least we're not that way.\" '''''What comedians do you consider exceptions to this trend?'''''I think that Conan O'Brien, what he does on his show, is really remarkable, for the reason that he has been able to bring a kind of benign intelligence into his comedy, where it's smart and it's funny, but it's not imposing and it's not critical. Letterman made the comedy smart, but it's almost like meanness was part of the baggage. And he [O'Brien] took the meanness out of it in a way that I wasn't sure anyone could do. I was like, \"Oh, someone can do this and still keep it smart!\" '''''The assumption is that when there's an edge to something, that edge could be cruel.'''''Or a submerged anger that is actually anger at a different variety of meanness that has no point. I mean, when you listen to Bill Hicks, some people are shocked by it. I don't like everything he does, but he does rail against people buying into the dumbing-down of the culture. It's so unusual to hear someone say, \"Look, this is ridiculous! It's OK to think about things and talk seriously about things!\" It's kind of shocking to hear someone say that, because there's this reverse-snobbery thing, where if you try to talk seriously or fool any character in a movie who's impassioned, unless it's a romantic comedy, it's ridiculous. But if you read a Russian novel, everybody has all that fervor. We're the exact opposite of a Russian novel now: There's no fervor. It shouldn't be one way or another, like people running around and eating their hearts out because life is so painful or there's so much to be done. But it seems like we've gone way over to this other numb, kind of cackling extreme that's a waste of time for me. '''What's In a Word?''' '''''What role does humor play in your music and your poetry?'''''In both of them, it kind of plays the same role, which is as a palliative. I don't feel that comfortable being heavy all the time. I could, but I'm making concessions to the world I live in. So I use humor as a way to say something to get my horse in through the gates of Troy. Or sometimes it's the opposite: I may set up a joke with sadness. But I can never seem to work with just one or the other, or very rarely. They seem to be one and the same. That seems to be part of a Jewish tradition too. There's a nobility to humor, and there's a strength to sadness. So you form a bridge between things that you can't normally see a bridge between. '''''In your lyrics, that often seems to come down to creating short phrases and images that kind of jump off the record.'''''I'm fighting with myself, because there's a natural tendency to go with the cheap shot. '''''There are plenty of examples on American Water: \"Like background singers, they all come in threes.\" And the line about the coda in \"Smith & Jones Forever,\" which is kind of an inside musician's joke. Or \"I've been lonely since she found Christ,\" which is like a country line, but with a sting to it.'''''It's turning clichés on their heads. I'm thinking of my line about the \"honky-tonk psychiatrist.\" Now, when I take a sad situation, like the cliché of someone crying in his beer in a bar, I don't feel that I'm trying to dismantle it by then turning the bartender into a psychiatrist or reducing it to the absurdity of there actually being a psychiatrist in a honky-tonk. I feel that I'm trying to reinvigorate the cliché. So it's not out of a disrespect for these situations; it's in a sense trying to save them from being deadened. '''''And when you approach a level of ire, you do so gently enough to make your point without getting too snarly about it.'''''Yeah. I don't feel comfortable with extremes, and I don't feel comfortable with the middle of the road. So I tend to set extremes next to each other. The title of the record, for instance, with \"American,\" which is maybe as abstract a concept as you can envision, and \"Water,\" maybe the most concrete image you can envision, put together is basically nothing. There's no such thing as \"American water,\" but I like to put two extremes together like that, extremes of humor or extremes of sadness, and see if they can interlock and create a continuity rather than create a friction. '''''Is it really as simple as just juxtaposing unrelated things?'''''Sometimes I do that, and it's kind of a cheap comic effect or a cheap aesthetic effect. But I don't feel like I'm putting them in juxtapositions; I feel like I'm putting things together that have a true natural relationship that's under the radar. It's not an artificial relationship. '''''What do you mean by \"under the radar\"?'''''Well, people classify and categorize elements of life. Like, I have my book here. I'll open it up to any page, and here's a line about \"scars on a toymaker's hand,\" right? \"Toys\" and \"scars\" are put into different categories really easily by people's minds. An old toymaker would most definitely have scars on his hands, but when you look at a toy you're not going to make the bridge back to that. So it's not a weird juxtaposition; it's a true juxtaposition. It's just weird because your mind isn't gonna travel the whole way every time you look at an object, to find all the points that it's a nexus for. '''''Which poem is that?'''''That's in the \"Cantos for James Michener.\" . . . There, again: \"Cantos\" and \"Michener.\" An easy cheap shot. But it was more than that. At first it kind of was a cheap shot, when I wrote it down. But then I started to learn more about James Michener. First he was just the guy with the ridiculous Reader's Digest books on my grandfather's shelves. But then I learned that he had donated his art collection to the University of Texas, and I was living in Austin then, so every week I'd go hang out in that gallery and look at those paintings. Then I started to see that he was a benefactor to the writing program at UT. So it stopped becoming such a joke, and after a while it really was for him, because he was really doing these things. '''''Although the use of the word \"cantos\" . . .'''''Yeah, it's still gonna retain that tease. But you can tease someone lovingly. '''Poetry vs. Music''' '''''There are parallels in your lyric and poetic writing. \"In 1984 I was hospitalized for approaching perfection,\" from \"Random Rules,\" kind of mirrors \"She was destroyed when they were busted for operating a private judicial system within U.S. borders,\" from your poem \"Classic Water.\"'''''Oh, yeah. Everyone gets one weapon, or two weapons if they're lucky. Certainly, if you meet someone who has a method to their fiction writing, you'd find that they use some of those methods in their socializing at a party. As much as artists want you to think they leave their work behind when they leave the desk, it can't be true. '''''So what are the differences between writing for music and writing for the page? Is it just a question of structure?'''''It goes beyond that. There's a certain Charlie Rich-ian emotion that's simple and simplistic, which you can go for in music. That's sometimes achievable in poetry, but it's more difficult, because music plays on the heart. Poetry can play on the heart too, but it takes longer and it's much harder. The real difference is that it's easier to write a song but it's harder to write a good song. '''''Because you can rely on things other than words when writing a song.'''''Right. That's why I have a double relationship with it. I'd rather sit down and write a poem: I know what the materials are. There aren't many variable factors you have to control, like you do in a studio, so there's less anxiety in sitting down to write. But I'll never get as much pleasure out of any poem as I get when a song all comes together, because that's miraculous. '''''Do you sit down with the intention of writing either a poem or a song?'''''Yeah. '''''So ideas come to you in different packages. If you're working on a song, you want to fit everything into eight-bar structures.'''''Yeah, and usually I'll use a more limited palette, in the sense that usually it's gonna be about a man and a woman, or a man alone. I'm not gonna write a song about Isaac Asimov or James Michener; that's too far-flung, and you're asking too much of an audience. And music like that doesn't appeal to me. That's like They Might Be Giants, where everything is a subject. To me, that's goofy. Music requires . . . I won't say more dignity, but it's a different kind of dignity, and a different kind of concession to your audience. '''''Can we assume, then, that audiences for your poetry are more open to elevated ideas than those who might buy Silver Jews CDs?'''''Yeah, I think you can. I mean, I think that if it's the type of person who reads books, by this time in their life they've decided that they're going to a book for a reason. They're not going because they want to hum a song in their head. I mean, there are multiple reasons why someone buys a CD. Some may not be interested in any meaning in the CD; they'll be like, \"Well, I don't listen to words!\" But no one reads a book and goes, \"I don't read the words.\" The words are there. They have one purpose. Music can be other things. '''''Who exactly is your audience?'''''No one really knows anymore. It's so divided, diffused. I've always been amused by the idea of a Book of the Month Club - like, who are the other people in your club? No one really knows. Many times you'll meet a friend of yours and they've read some of the same books, but it took months before you realized they're readers. It's almost like a secret society, except in New York, where it's not so uncommon. But you never really know who reads and who doesn't. I often ask myself that question. I got a box of my books the other day, and I went down to this bar where I know a lot of people, and I was just handing them out. I figured no one was gonna go buy it themselves. But before I would give one to someone, I would say, \"Do you read? I'm not gonna give this to you if you don't read.\" It wasn't a dumb question. It should be a dumb question, but it isn't. A lot of people would be like, \"Uh, no, not really.\" \"When was the last time you read a book?\" \"A couple years ago. In college. It's boring!\" Not to make fun of people like that . . . but, you know, I'm not gonna apologize for making fun of people like that. I'm not talking about people who've never had the chance, who've never been led by the nose to books. These are people who've been to college and have turned their backs on books in the same way that they've turned their backs on the news and turned their backs on other people's suffering. It's like that old William Carlos Williams line, which I can paraphrase: It's hard to find the news in poetry, but men die every day for lack of what is found there. I really believe that. '''''Maybe a project such as the Silver Jews takes that into consideration. You're still addressing serious messages to people, even if it's not an active literary audience.''''' Certainly. I'm glad that my book is coming out, because there will be a lot of Silver Jews fans who don't go to books but who may, for the first time, be convinced that it's not all just John Dryden and Alfred Lord Tennyson. I kind of feel like I'm operating a ministry, like one of those guys on the street corner everyone's laughing at and no one's listening to. Not that my message is religious, but in general, especially for a lot of people today who don't have a spiritual life, you can find one in secular books. That's a kind of modern spirituality. Modernism definitely made that true, or at least tried to make that claim. I still think that's a possibility. '''\"Why Don't You Play Live?\"''' '''''When you began playing gigs with the Silver Jews, did you have to adjust your concepts of what to expect from the audience, compared to the receptions you'd already gotten at poetry readings?'''''Not really. In fact, we've only played shows for captive audiences - like we played last month at a wedding, or at a Drag City event. We've played maybe 10 shows, ever. I feel like what we do is different, almost in a different medium. I feel like I'm in the wrong place, almost like I had accidentally been shoved onstage at a theater where they're expecting a play or something. People may say they want it, and there are Silver Jews fans who say, \"No, we want you to play live.\" But I know the music isn't being served or improved. In fact, nothing is really being done when we play live, except you can see what we look like when we play the music. It sounds either just like the records or not as good. For the most part, when I guess I'm down to the brass tacks, it's to sell records. I know that we could sell probably 50 percent more records if we toured the last three albums, but even though I like to make the records, I'm not interested in selling the records. I want people to buy them, but the record company can sell them, as far as I'm concerned. I'm not gonna play live shows just to sell records. '''''It's probably easier to reproduce the sound of U2 in a stadium than it is to recreate the simple nuances of your records in a club.'''''Exactly, because there's so much moment in it. Sometimes there are mistakes. There's a vibe in the room, that's for sure, that carries a lot of the music, because technique isn't carrying it. So a lot of it is personality or things that you can't just turn on and off on a stage every night, 40 nights in a row. '''''Does the \"anti-showmanship\" riff in your \"Cassette County\" poem reflect this attitude toward performing?'''''Yeah, I was kind of thinking about that. I mean, it's kind of a present thing in my life, whether it's Drag City or people writing letters. Or when I go out at night, if I meet somebody, quite often he's a fan, and he's definitely gonna say, \"Why don't you play live?\" I'm always answering that question, and I'm always coming up with new answers. I don't necessarily know if I can tell them exactly why I don't, but I try to give them a bunch of reasons why I shouldn't. '''''Maybe mystique plays a role here.'''''Exactly. I don't want to ruin it by actually playing live [laughs]. '''The Anti-Message Era''''''''How important are lyrics in music today?'''''I really think we're in a time where you can look at the rise of instrumental music, of dance music, of music even in foreign languages - basically, music where no one has to listen to anyone tell a story or make a point. There seems to be a lot of that. My pet theory is that people go to entertainment that really speaks to them, that really answers their questions or even poses questions, in times of trouble - music that makes them think, makes them feel that there's a search. During the Depression in the 1930s, when people didn't have enough money for heating oil or food, you'd think that the first thing that would go would be money for movies and records. But that was a great boom time for entertainment in America. And now we have an opposite time, where people have never been so financially comfortable, especially in the middle and upper-middle classes. There's very few public issues that are dividing people. You really have to go to the talk TV shows to see people suffering, and it's over interpersonal stuff. I really think that people right now don't want to distract themselves from the fact that they're on this bubble. And what's better for that than some instrumental dance music? You can play it in your brand new car on your way to shop. If you put on, you know, \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall,\" you might start to look around outside of your brand new VW bug parked outside of the Gap and start to worry, like, \"Wait a second. Is this all really gonna last this way?\" I mean, at no time in history have we ever gone this long without a war! Any music that comes on and makes you ask if life can really be this way is gonna make you fucking anxious. So why not turn off the words? That's what the music and the TV does now. '''''During the Depression, you had both \"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\" and \"We're in the Money.\" Both confrontation and denial.'''''But we don't even have a \"We're in the Money\" in the sense that people will explicitly say that, even though they are [in the money]. People are trying to hide that. It's kind of like, no one's into conspicuous consumption, like in the '80s. But really, it's so conspicuous: Instead of big Cadillacs, it's SUVs. They're practical! So nobody's saying \"We're in the Money,\" and nobody's saying \"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\" either. It's just the music. '''''What does that mean to you as a musician?'''''Well, I keep wondering, should I be making music? Or should I just dump it and say it as clearly as I can through the page? It really comes down to how can I get the message out, because I want people to hear it! I'm not here just to bounce words off the walls. That's a decision I'll probably make over the next couple of years: Am I gonna keep making records? Is anyone really listening to this? Or should I just go for a smaller audience that I know is listening? '''''Which of your songs works best as a vehicle for your message?'''''The song on American Water, \"We Are Real,\" is one of those songs where, if you're not listening, it's not gonna be clear. But it's all there. What I mean is, you can be fooled by how quiet and folky and gentle it is, but the lyrics are actually extremely angry. It's kind of about a lot of what we're talking about: feeling like the world is trying to make you into a consumer when you know you're a human. To me, that was the most political song I ever did, in the sense that I really felt like what I was saying to anyone who was listening was, \"Come on, stop putting your faith in people who, above all, keep you shopping.\" People put their faith in people like that, whether it's government officials who need you to keep shopping, or business people who need you to keep shopping, or entertainers who need the commercials to keep going. So that was one where at least I knew what I was saying. When I was younger, I never would have said anything political like that in a song. I would have felt embarrassed. '''''How do such lyrics come about? Do you sit down with the intention of writing something political?'''''No, the beginnings are more stream-of-consciousness. I may have written down the words \"we are real\" somewhere, not knowing what I meant by it. Then I'll try to figure out what I meant by that. . . . Well, not what I meant by that, but what it could mean. I'm kind of in reverse, reading my own song and trying to figure it out. '''''Are any projects being planned for the Silver Jews?'''''We're gonna try to make a record in the fall. Me and Malkmus are going to Cambodia for a month at the end of December, so we'll try to do it before then. '''''Why Cambodia?'''''Well, a friend of mine has an apartment in Phnom Penh, and I've never been in such a place. It just seemed like a crazy idea to be there in 2000. '''''You may in fact be there for several months, depending on how Y2K plays out.'''''Who knows? I may be there for the rest of my life."

  "body": "by Stéphane Deschamps\"La photo de pochette de Starlite walker a été prise à Oxford, Mississippi, le pays de Faulkner C'est un endroit où j'ai passé beaucoup d'étés. \" Le pays est gorgé d'eau, d'humus, de parfums d'automne, On croirait une image sur papier sépia. Mais non, c'est la vraie couleur du paysage chaud et rouillé. Comme le premier album des Silver Jews, étonnant disque qui semble sorti de terre après une grosse averse d'été. Starlite walker ressemble à un petit jardin abandonné sous une tonnelle vermoulue. Un désordre harmonieux et naturel. Un lieu insoupçonné et silencieusement anarchique. Au plafond, une araignée. Le propriétaire s'appelle David Berman, 27 ans, juif, Sudiste, ancien croque-mort, serveur dans un restaurant, gardien de musée, auteur de nouvelles, cuisinier, voyageur, palefrenier pour joueurs de polo puis professeur dans un atelier d'écriture. Et aujourd'hui jardinier des Silver Jews, avec Steve et Bob de Pavement, \"Ils ont toujours fait partie des Silver Jews. Le groupe a vraiment commencé quand nous avons déménagé de Virginie a New York. Un ami nous avait donné le numéro de téléphone de Sonic Youth. On a appelé et joué une chanson sur leur répondeur. On a fait ça sur pas mal de répondeurs, avant de commencer à enregistrer sans téléphone. \" Un pied dans la Drag City connection, le label qui rafle aujourd'hui la mise aux Etats-Unis, \"Les Palace Brothers ont connu Drag City par le single des Silver Jews et les Silver Jews ont connu Drag City par Pavement.,\" Pavement, Palace Brothers, Silver Jews, Pale Horse Riders, Silver Palace (projet entre David Berman et Will Oldham) - tous les mêmes, des musiciens qui ont usé les mêmes bancs d'école, grandi ensemble, respiré le même air sudiste, sont partis, puis revenus, ont siffloté les mêmes ritournelles inouïes, \"Si ma musique ressemble parfois à Pavement, c'est parce que ce sont mes amis, on s'est influencés réciproquement. J'écris toutes les chansons, mais Steve apporte un style parce qu'il est bien meilleur musicien que moi, il m'aide à habiller les chansons dont j'écris les paroles. Ce songwriting partagé vient du fait qu'on essaie d'exprimer des choses par la mélodie et pas seulement par des paroles sensées. Ça vient aussi de nos personnalités, passionnées à l'intérieur, plus dures à l'extérieur. \" La musique est aussi indolente et douce à l'oreille que l'énoncé des états qui l'ont vue naître - Mississippi, Virginie, Géorgie. Décadente et lascive, mais jamais typique. Aussi nomade que ceux qui l'ont faite. \"Pendant des années, je n'ai pas eu de domicile fixe. J'ai voyagé aux Etats - Unis, en Pologne, en Afrique, en France. Je suis venu trois fois en France, j'aime la tombe de Napoléon, les jardins du Luxembourg et les belles femmes. Elles me rendent fou car je les suis dans la rue, elles n'ont pas peur. Alors je les aime encore plus. \" Inclassable, la musique : un The Fall avec de la steel-guitar, Television sur K records. Combien de groupes nous ont donné l'impression de se foutre royalement des usages, des manières du rock et de l'industrie ? Beaucoup. Mais combien ont dépassé le stade de l'intention ? \"Le côté étrange de ma musique vient du fait que j'essaie de remplir des blancs, d'aller vers des espaces vierges. L'observation et l'instinct m'aident à découvrir de nouveaux espaces dans la musique. Le Mississippi est préservé parce que cet état a été ignoré pendant des années par le reste du pays. C'est un endroit où on peut encore ressentir des choses authentiques. Au pays comme derrière les instruments : une affaire de copains, aristocrates déchus qui font de grandes choses avec des petits moyens. Un disque qui n'évoque pas l'attitude rock ou la musique enregistrée, mais d'abord des tranches de vie sous la moustiquaire."

  "body": "Interview from PARABOLE N°4 Automne 98C'est étrange, je ne fais pas beaucoup d'interviews en France. Peut-être que ça ne colle pas, avec les journalistes d'ici. Pourtant, nous recevons plus de lettres de France que de n'importe quel autre pays d'Europe, même d'Angleterre. J'ai l'impression que les français sont moins timides. En tout cas, ce sont les êtres les plus en paix avec eux-mêmes que je connaisse. Quand on regarde dans la rue, ici, comparé à Londres, New York ou Berlin, les gens donnent l'impression de n'avoir besoin de rien, ni de personne. Ils n'ont pas, comme les gens à New York, ce regard qui vous dit «j'ai besoin de quelque chose». Les français ont juste l'air totalement détendus, confiants, satisfaits d'une certaine façon. C'est pour ça que j'adore les françaises: elles vous ignorent, elles n'ont pas besoin de vous. Et autant que je sache, elles n'ont pas besoin de mentir. C'est bien mieux ainsi. Avec les américaines, je n'ai eu que des problèmes. '''''On a le sentiment que ce troisième album est plus extraverti musicalement, les guitares y sont plus présentes, plus violentes.'''''Oui, absolument. C'est curieux, c'est le processus inverse de la plupart des groupes, qui expriment toute leur violence sur les deux premiers albums puis s'apaisent en vieillissant. Mais je crois que cela est dû aux conditions dans lesquelles je l'ai composé j 'étais constamment sur la route, en voyage, jamais vraiment isolé, ce qui a permis ce côté extraverti? D'ailleurs cet aspect a guidé tout l'enregistrement: il y avait toujours plein de gens avec nous, on faisait la fête sans arrêt; on prenait beaucoup de drogues, surtout après les séances, et on allait traîner dehors, au milieu des gens. Il se produit une certaine vulnérabilité dans une telle situation, on s'expose beaucoup plus qu'en restant isolé dans un studio. Dès le départ, ces chansons étaient comme nues face à l'âpreté de la ville, à la foule. Cet album est donc un peu plus rock, plus rapide, plus brumeux aussi. Nous nous sommes vraiment éclatés, il fallait donc que toute cette énergie ressorte. '''''Pourtant votre musique est toujours assez mélancolique, les paroles et les structures très décalés. Est-ce encore le reflet de ta personnalité?'''''Je crois que, finalement, c'est le reflet de toute ma vie. Quand j'étais enfant, j 'étais vraiment introverti, et je me suis libéré en grandissant. Même aujourd'hui, en dépit de ce que je peux ressentir, je m'efforce d'être toujours social, sympa; je n'aime pas que mes actes traduisent mon humeur du moment, je ne me sens pas assez libre pour ça. Il y a toujours en moi des sentiments mêlés de tristesse et de bonheur, qui luttent sans arrêt. Je n'aime pas être guidé par un seul sentiment à la fois, que ce soit la joie ou le désespoir... Finalement, je n'arrive jamais à être honnête dans mon rapport au monde, je ne peux pas me complaire dans tel état d'esprit car je ne suis jamais certain de rien. Et cela se ressent dans ma musique, j'essaye toujours d'être prudent, de jouer sur les deux tableaux. '''''Tu as l'air très attaché à l'espace, aux paysages qui t'entourent, comme le montrent tes pochettes. Est-ce une source d'inspiration pour ton écriture?'''''D'habitude je vis à la campagne, mais je vis à Austin depuis quelque temps déjà. Je ne sais pas si les paysages m'inspirent tant que ça... C'est plutôt une tentative de réparation, essayer que ces images marquent l'esprit des gens; je veux toujours une pochette qui exprime le calme, la quiétude. Une sorte de combat personnel contre le chaos ambiant. '''''As-tu le temps de poursuivre tes activités littéraires?'''''J'écris beaucoup de poésie, un livre va sortir bientôt. J'écris tout le temps, c'est quelque chose qui m'accapare en permanence. Je n’arrive pas à me contenter de faire des chansons, de les construire ; j 'ai toujours envie d'autre chose, de ne pas faire que de la musique. '''''Comment as-tu travaillé pour le second album, sans Steve et Bob?'''''Je l'ai enregistré avec d'autres musiciens. C'était difficile de composer sans Steve, mais c'était un choix. Je crois que ces chansons étaient juste entre Dieu et moi, et je ne souhaitais pas la présence de gens que je connais, juste des «étrangers». C'est un disque très personnel, très intime, et il est parfois difficile d'être intime en présence de ses amis. Il n'y avait donc pas de place pour eux. C'était important pour moi de faire ce disque tout seul, de me retrouver isolé: lorsque je compose avec Steve, il faut toujours retravailler les chansons pour qu'elles nous plaisent à tous les deux, faire des concessions. Et pour ce disque je ne voulais pas en faire. '''''Considères-tu les Silver Jews comme faisant partie des groupes qui puisent leur inspiration dans de fortes racines américaines?'''''Oui, mais en même temps il me semble que ce n'est qu'un point de départ qu'il s'agit ensuite de pervertir, de combattre. Il y a suffisamment de groupes ringards aux Etats-Unis qui perpétuent la musique country, qui y croient à fond et veulent faire partie de cette tradition. Pour nous, c'est surtout une base dont nous faisons quelque chose d'inattendu, de non conventionnel. '''''Et crois-tu que votre musique peut être ressentie de la même façon par un américain et un européen?'''''Je crois surtout que les européens l'écoutent avec plus d'attention. Ici, vous avez en permanence accès aux rêves, aux illusions que l'Amérique veut produire? Et notre musique est à l'opposé de tout ça. Alors, il y a toujours ce décalage, ce rapport bizarre qui fait qu'un européen trouvera nos disques très américains, mais un américain les trouvera «un-american», obscurs, excentriques. Cette musique n'a pas sa place dans son pays. '''''Tu n'as pas l'air de porter l'Amérique dans ton coeur.'''''Pas du tout, j'adore ce pays! pour rien au monde je ne voudrais vivre ailleurs. J'aime l'Amérique probablement plus que quiconque, et je voudrais avoir plusieurs vies pour la connaître encore mieux. C'est une source constante d'inspiration et de fascination. Bien sûr, il y a des aspects que je rejette totalement: je déteste la Californie, ses habitants, l'Océan, Hollywood, la culture de la célébrité. Ca me rend fou de rage, mais c'est comme aimer quelqu'un: il y a toujours des choses qu'on déteste mais qu'on supporte par amour. De toute façon, s'il devait y avoir une révolution dans ce pays, il faudrait plutôt brûler Hollywood que Washington. '''''A quoi ressemble un concert des Silver Jews?'''''Oh, c'est toujours différent. Nous n'avons fait que sept concerts en sept ans. La dernière fois, c'était juste Steve et moi, deux guitares, deux amplis. On aurait dit du free-jazz... La fois d'avant, juste moi au micro avec un groupe, il y avait David Grubbs et Jim O'Rourke. Mais sur la prochaine tournée, ce sera le groupe qui a enregistré l'album. '''''Et où en est ton projet avec Will Oldham, « Silver Palace»?'''''C'est toujours en cours... Mais Silver Palace est surtout une amitié, il n'y a pas vraiment de musique (rire). Nous avons essayé d'enregistrer cet été, mais ce n'était pas génial. Du moins pas meilleur que ce que chacun de nous fait de son côté. On ne se sent pas vraiment obligés de le faire, ça ne servirait à rien de se forcer. Et puis chacun de nous devient le producteur de l'autre pour quelques chansons. Je trouve ça vraiment amusant, j'aime bien être un peu plus dans l'ombre mais pouvoir faire des choix, avoir le dernier mot. Pouvoir tirer les ficelles. '''''Il y a cette phrase, sur l'album: «why is there something instead of nothing ? ». A-t-elle une signification précise pour toi?'''''C'est une question philosophique très simple et très ancienne, mais tellement évidente et inévitable. Quel est le sens de tout ce qui nous entoure? je trouve cette interrogation très pesante et très belle à la fois. Je ne sais plus quel philosophe l'a posée ni en quels termes exacts... (silence).. peut-être Schopenhauer. Un jour, à l'école, le prof nous sort cette phrase et nous demande d'y réfléchir... ça m'a beaucoup marqué, sans doute. Je sais au fond de moi qu'il y a une signification dans tout ça, mais je ne sais pas laquelle. Je prie tous les jours, j'entretiens une vraie relation avec Dieu; et je sens que des principes gouvernent ma vie. J'essaie toujours de m'améliorer en tant qu'être humain ; je sais que j'ai cette responsabilité en échange de la vie qui m'a été donnée, de vivre honnêtement, correctement. Mais tout ça ne transparaît pas forcément dans ma musique, je n'y exprime pas mon entière personnalité. Pourtant je n'ai jamais voulu paraître totalement détaché de ces choses, ni complètement cynique. '''''Et d'où vient «Like like the the the death »?'''''Au départ, c'était une chanson pour Silver Palace. Nous étions chez Diane, la copine de Will, je cherchais un refrain. Et elle avait ces trucs magnétiques qu'on met sur la porte du frigo, qui formaient cette phrase... Ca signifie juste une certaine idée de la confusion. Mais l'interprétation que fait l'auditeur est tellement bizarre... Sur «Smiths and Jones forever», par exemple: en argot, «to jones» signifie attendre son dealer. Et un ami avait compris que je chantais «sit and jones forever » '''''Y a-t-il des disques qui t'ont marqué récemment?'''''Celui de Rufus Wainwright, j'aime beaucoup. Mais j'achète très peu de disques.... ah Si, le dernier Page & Plant est très bien.... (rire général). '''''Au fait, où en sont tes relations avec Frank Black? (1)'''''Je ne lui ai pas parlé depuis cette fameuse nuit (rire). J'ai lu une interview de lui sur Internet, où on lui parlait de cette histoire, et apparemment il ne m'en veut plus. Du moins c'est ce qu'il prétend. Je ne sais toujours pas s'il a fini par écouter l'album... de toute façon, le disque était cassé... je me souviens qu'il était très en colère. Bon sang, j'étais complètement soûl, ce soir-là.... j'ai une mauvaise habitude: quand je suis bourré, j'ai envie de me battre. Mais je m'excuse, vraiment. '''''Mais tu aimes toujours les Pixies ?'''''Bien sûr. Sur disque. (I) En 95, à la recherche d'un producteur pour son second album, David Berman souhaitait rencontrer Frank Black à la fin de son concert. Mais devant le peu d'intérêt de Black, Berman lui a lancé un exemplaire de Starlite Walker en plein visage, avant d'être expulsé de la loge."

  "title": "Interview in French 4 - from Pinky-Poo N°2",
  "body": "Dans la galaxie Pavement, Silver Jews n'est pas seulement une récréation musicale et encore moins un side-band de Stephen Malkmus. C'est David Berman - ami/collaborateur/inspirateur de Pavement depuis leurs débuts qui est aux commandes de ce groupe assez typique de l'esprit du label Drag City. Pour ajouter à la confusion, c'est Steve West, batteur des deux groupes (avec Bob Nastanovich) qui répond à nos questions. '''''A quand remontent les premiers enregistrements des Silver Jews ?'''''//David et Stephen se sont connus sur les bancs de l'université de Virginie. Ils jouaient tous dans un groupe qui s'appelait Ectoslavia.. Je crois que c'est la que tout a commencé. Ils sont ensuite montés a New York, où je travaillais. et nous nous sommes rencontrés. L'activité du groupe se résumait surtout â des répétitions assez sauvages dans l'appartement de Bob: il s'agissait de faire le maximum de bruit. Les enregistrements se faisaient sur un tout petit magnéto de rien du tout. Quand les singles de Pavement ont commencé a éveiller l'attention. nous nous sommes dits. qu'après tout. nous pourrions éditer les titres enregistrés avec les Silver Jews. On voulait aussi garder cette attitude qui consiste a se réunir entre nous a New York, Jouer, enregistrer avec ce qui nous tombe sous la main. nous saouler la gueule et passer un bon moment. David est écrivain. sa tête est toujours au seuil de l'explosion tellement il y a d'idées qui y grouillent Alors on se met derrière lui et on l'accompagne avec nos instruments. '''''Les Silver Jews sont donc nés avant Pavement ?'''''//Non. je crois que les deux groupes sont nés en même temps. Scott connaissait déja Steven depuis l'université. Silver Jews était un projet initialement conçu à New York par David, Steven et moi. On restait la à se demander Si nous allions nous appeler Silver Jews ou Walnutt Falcons. quel serait le nom du disque ou quelles chansons figureraient dessus. A l'époque, Bob était chauffeur de bus, je travaillais au musée de Manhattan. On traînait pas mal ensemble, c'était vers 1990-1991. '''''Pourquoi avoir finalement choisi le nom de Silver Jews?'''''//Tu sais, quand tu utilises le mot juif, tu sais qu'il va retenir l'attention, quelle qu'en soit l'occasion. C'est une référence aux personnes juives qui ont des cheveux blonds. On les appelle les silverjews aux Etats-Unis; c'est une expression toute faite. David et Steven ont également des origines juives, alors nous avons opté pour ce nom. Il se retient bien, et il nous amusait pas mal. '''''J'ai lu que vous aviez appelé Sonie Youth pour laisser une longue impro, que vous jouiez en direct, sur leur répondeur ?'''''//Oui, je m'en souviens. Bob, David et moi avions pris des vacances a Austin, au Texas. Le trajet est assez long depuis New York et nous avions pas mal picolé, surtout du vin. Il se trouve que Bob connaissait le numéro de téléphone de Sonic Youth, étant donné qu'il avait tourné avec eux en Europe. Un soir, alors que nous étions bourrés, nous les avons appelés pour leur jouer quelques chansons au téléphone. Kim et Thurston n'étaient pas la et on est tombés sur leur répondeur. Heureusement, ils n'ont jamais édité cette bande Nous avions juste une guitare, moi je tapais sur une poubelle que je tenais au dessus de ma tête. J'étais bien déchiré. Il y avait aussi d'autres personnes avec nous, qui tapaient sur des ustensiles variés. J'en garde un excellent souvenir. '''''Quel était le but de ce genre de prestations ? Vous faire connaître ?'''''//Non. Tu sais, quand tu as bu, que tu veux parler a un ami et que tu tombes sur son répondeur, tu te dis que tu vas lui laisser un message rigolo. C'est tout. '''''Je me souviens avoir lu une chronique du single Dime Map of The Reef disant que le son était trop mauvais pour qu'on puisse dire quoi que ce soit des chansons.'''''//Ah oui. je me souviens l'avoir lu aussi. C'était plutôt triste. Je trouve les chansons des Silver Jews superbes, mais il est vrai que parfois les gens ne se donnent pas la peine de les écouter a cause du son, en particulier pour les premiers enregistrements. Ce n'est qu'avec Starlite Walker que les critiques se sont mis a nous écouter. Avant, ils avaient une attitude du genre \"c' est lo-fi, alors ça ne vaut pas la peine\". C'est dommage, parce que je trouve les premiers enregistrements des Jews vraiment puissants. Il faut juste pousser ta chaîne un peu plus fort. Fais attention en particulier an son de guitare. L'idéal pour les écouter, c'est quand tu es avec des amis, parce que ce sont des disques où il y a une ambiance de fête. C'est l'esprit des Jews :les réunions, les fêtes. '''''La spontanéité semble occuper une plus grande place chez Silver Jews que chez Pavement.'''''//Non, c'est pratiquement pareil. Les chansons sont peut-être un peu plus calculées, mais quand nous en sommes au stade de l'écriture, c est la même chose : nous savons où nous voulons aller, mais nous ne sommes pas assez bon pour y arriver. Donc, nous cherchons une autre voie pour essayer de nous en rapprocher tout en gardant un certain esprit, en nous amusant. '''''Peut-on dire qu'il existe une philosophie Silver Jews ?'''''//D'une certaine façon, oui. Il n'y a eu qu'une seule chanson de Pavement qui ait été diffusée régulièrement a la radio, c'est Cut Your Hair. Le problème, quand tu es sur une grosse maison de disques, c'est que tu es sensé faire un album parfaitement calibré pour les radios, rempli de pop-songs. ça obsède tellement ces majors que tout le reste va leur sembler accessoire, même Si c'est l'esprit du groupe qui est en jeu. J'en parlais à l'instant avec les musiciens de Shudder To Think qui me disaient que leur maison de disques voulait qu'ils fassent un album a gros budget. très professionnel. Ce qui veut dire limiter toute la partie expérimentale. J'ai écouté leur dernier album et j'ai apprécié la façon dont il avait été enregistré. Ils ont empêché qu'on intervienne sur leur son. Un bon nombre de groupes tombent facilement dans le panneau. Si tu rentres dans le circuit des majors tu deviens tellement préoccupé par le souci que tout soit parfait et fini à temps que tu en oublies le principal : faire de bonnes chansons. '''''Peux-tu m'expliquer ce qu'il faut comprendre par le nom du split-single The Silver Jews and Nico?'''''//Nico. c'est moi. Bob n'a pas participé à celui la. Il a vécu pendant un moment a Louisville; Dave, Steven et moi étions les seuls à New York. Comme il s'agissait du premier enregistrement des Jews auquel je participais, il fallait qu'ils me présentent. C'est pourquoi ils ont rajouté and Nico. '''''Que s’est il passé entre David et Frank Black?'''''//David s'est pointé a la fin d'un de ses concerts dans le Massachusetts, et il a demandé à le rencontrer backstage. Mais son manager n'a pas voulu le laisser entrer dans sa loge. Nous savons tous que Frank Black est quelqu'un d'un peu rude, et qu'il y a toujours des gens qui veulent te voir a la fin des concerts pour te féliciter. Alors tu leur serres la main et tu les remercies. Ce n'est pas spécialement agréable, parce qu'en général ils ont bien bu avant, mais ce sont des fans et tu leur dois un certain respect. David s'est pointé avec un exemplaire de Starlite Walker - je suppose qu'il avait bien bu lui aussi - mais il s'est fait refuser l'entrée, et le manager a commencé a le pousser un peu violemment. David était tellement déçu, lui, un grand fan des Pixies, d'être traité de cette façon, qu'il a pris le CD et l'a balancé en hurlant \"you can 't fuckin' have it !\" Le boîtier s'est brisé contre le mur et a légèrement touché Frank Black à la tète - mais je doute que cela lui ait fait mal. Alors ils ont foutu David dehors et ont appelé les flics; mais. comme c'est un gars du coin, les spectateurs ont pris sa défense, et finalement les flics ne l'ont pas embarqué. Les journalistes ont repris l’événement sous la forme \"Pauvre Frank Black\"... Je ne croîs pas qu'il soit à plaindre. '''''Est-ce que David a trouvé un autre producteur depuis ?'''''//Non, je ne crois pas qu'il ait jamais cherché à se faire produire par Frank Black. Nous allons enregistrer un autre disque au moins d'octobre, et nous le produirons nous-mêmes, comme d'habitude. Je pense qu'il sortira sur Drag City, comme les autres. '''''Y aura t-il une tournée des Silver Jews ?'''''//Nous commençons à y penser très sérieusement. Je ne pense pas que Pavement sorte un disque avant l'automne 1996. Nous aurons alors un peu de temps pour faire une petite tournée avec les Jews. Ne serait-ce que pour promotionner le disque. Ce sera sympa de tourner avec une équipe différente; je crois que Bob, Steven et moi en avons besoin. Tu sais, quand tu te retrouves à vivre 24h/24 aux côtés des mêmes personnes, ça finit par devenir pesant. Mais on adore tourner, ne serait-ce que pour rencontrer d'autres groupes. C'est pourquoi les Silver Jews tourneront. PINKY-POO N°2 - 1996 - Propos recueillis par Emmanue"

  "title": "Not Mad About You - interviewed by Amy Sohn",
  "body": "Poet and song writer David Berman is a rebel, a mess and a mensch. Since 1993, as a frontman for the Silver Jews, he has chronicled disaffection and loss with quirky, intelligent humour and sharp, often ambiguous lyrics. On their new album, American Water, out next week on Drag City, the Jews (whose current line-up includes Steve Malkmus, Tim Barnes, Michael Fellows and Chris Stroffolino) seem smarter and sadder than ever before. Berman says he wrote most of the songs on the road and in public spaces, and it sounds like it. With lines like, \"The birds of Virginia are flying within you/and like background singers they all come in threes\" and \"The factories on muscle relaxers/The pine perfume of hilltown floors/the lover, the thinker, the talker, the singer/won't be lucid for her anymore,\" he takes us on a tour of the country and his own strange mind. ''You've been compared to Dylan. How much of an influence is he?''I've really just started listening to him in the last couple of years ... I think he's great, but there should be someone greater, and I don't know what will happen, if it will happen. It's just not encouraged. Basically, the encouragement you get if you're a musician is to make use of the endless stupid well of young people and take advantage of that and wear cool clothes and strike poses and speak in only empty conundrums, and when that's encouraged by rock critics and the rock business and the facilitators, you end up with a really dumb and small pool of talent. ''Examples?''Green Day, REO Speedwagon and Hole. I had a horrible dream about worms wriggling, grubs and maggots emerging out of Courtney Love's pussy- this nest of wriggling maggots and worms. It was so awful. ''How do you know it was hers?'' It smelled like it. ''There's a line on the album, \"I love your ... Protestant thighs\" Why don't you love Jewish thighs?'' I do love Jewish, but that was a character. Remember the cutters? They were like the townies, and there was the I.U. [Indiana University] fraternity/sorority set, and so he's just in love with a woman from afar, from the other side of the tracks, and the character's a Cutter. When you're younger- and that's definitely a kid- you want to conquer what won't have you, and so if you grow up maybe not so wealthy and in a town where there aren't many other Jews, you already feel like an outsider. You don't necessarily go for a member of your own tribe. You're really attracted to what's unattainable ... I grew up in Dallas and in the eighties especially, it was very ostentatious and a lot of wealth, and a lot of the adults were distracted by the pursuit of their own sensual pleasures and money, so the kids were sort of left on their own ... I was sort of in that world but without the money ...''Did you go to a public or a private school?'' A private school that was [small] and ... hippie ... We had a 75-year-old English teacher, this guy who grew up on the Rio Grande, this really old man who seemed like a cowboy, but he would spend a whole week just with the word \"fuck\" on the board, talking about the power of the word. ''I thought you grew up poor.'' I did. My dad was determined that I wouldn't go to public school and so he did everything he could to get me in there. But we lived on food stamps for a long time. ''Were you raised religious?'' Not at all ... My dad really turned his back on religion ... but in a way, it's made it easier to raise myself through a kind of religion. I feel like I have a personal relationship with God and I pray all the time. That's the kind of thing that saves lives. ''Are you living in New York now?'' I'm staying here ... I don't think I can really stay here because I get really self destructive in New York, just party too much. I'm always worn down. I don't work enough ... I'm meant to be a good person and New York somehow seduces me into the darkside. I think I was born to be a rabbi or a reverend or something, but I'm turning into a fucking pimp. ''Is your music a way of being a rabbi?'' Yeah, I think it's a way, in the sense that if I had to say what about the music was most apparently singular to me, it would be a hyperconsciousness of the listener and speaking to somebody and paying them respect through not speaking down to them ... I know a lot of people who really only want to listen to instrumental music ... and in a situation like that, you don't really want to be spoken to. You [just want] a soundtrack to your shopping. Dance music is just sort of a soundtrack to shopping, like Microsoft commercials ... ''Who do you listen to that's contemporary?'' I like Rufus Wainwright's record a lot ... And it's funny to me because all my friends think I'm not fairly open. I have gay friends and stuff but people think I make fun of homosexuals too much. And I love his music and its openly homosexual ... I had some bad physical altercations with lesbians a couple of years ago in Northampton where two or three times some bulldykes tried to kick my ass ... We just don't get along. I don't have any lesbian friends. I have a problem with them ... Melissa Etheridge, ucch ... I'd turn on a woman's music show in Northampton and all the music would be playing to the worst and most cliched stereotypes of male blues rock, like beer commercial soundtrack rock, and this is supposed to be women's music. Even men, intelligent men, will not play to those bullshit music clichés, and I don't know why they want to do that, and cut their hair like Eisenhower, lawn-obsessed family men ...''What singers do you like? You say on the album that \"all my favourite singers couldn't sing.\"'' These people like Townes Van Zandt and Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen and Willie Nelson, they were all told that they couldn't sing their own songs. These are the people who were writing the interesting songs, who had something to say, and they knew that they were the only ones who could say it right ... When I listen to music, I want to hear a person and a person that I trust. I don't want to hear the sound of a culture ... Rock'n' roll started when the lessons were ripped up and burned, it was just, \" This is charisma, this is personality, this is persona,\" and it's given to you and it's a real confrontation with the person in the room, and that's what I seek out ... If there's a revolution in America, which I can never conceive of, it wouldn't be a rebel army marching into Washington and burning it down. It would be a rebel army marching into Hollywood and burning it down, and everyone would cheer ... [I]f Whoopi Goldberg got in a horrible car accident with Sean Lennon, I know a lot of people who would celebrate- not the death of these individuals, but the death of what they mean. Which is a bunch of bullshit, which is basically untalented people who have nothing to offer occupying a lot of space and money and time, and this machine keeps going on and it turns people into audiences and I resent that ... ''Is that why you didn't tour your last album?'' I have a huge reluctance. I don't understand why four animals should be onstage while 200 animals are watching them ... [U]nless you're really bring the music alive in a way that you weren't on the record, you should just get off the stage 'cause all you're doing at that point is asking for more money ... ''But you do have plans to tour this album.'' Because of what this record is, because it has a story that isn't completely written on the record. The other records were done when they were done and I didn't have anything else to say about them ... [With this one,] I need to see the look on peoples' faces ... It's irresponsible to me to just make music about yourselves, and about your worries. All this bullshit like Elliott Smith or something like that. People are actually asking you to pay a lot of money so you can bring their problems into your house. That's not what it's about for me. I'm not going to pay for someone else's therapy ...''Aren't you doing the same thing as Elliott Smith, just beneath a few more layers of disguise?'' No, because when I bring a problem in, number one, I'll try to leaven it with hope or humour, and number two, the problem isn't just mine ... [Smith and others like him] have made their business making me the audience of their problems ... When I write music, I really hope, whether it's true or not, I'm trying to write music for people who aren't even born yet ... Not to tie it down to contemporary or transitory angst ... I find Sebadoh's music already to be dated for that reason, because it seems to be tied up with a kind of self-indulgent, early nineties gloom. ''How did you come up with the name of your band?'' It was in 1989 and I had just moved to New York and I was on the subway with my friend Steve [Malkmus] and we needed a name for the band and he said, \"It should be silver something\" ... And then maybe there was something across from me with a yarmulke or something ... Jew is just a proper noun and it's a beautiful word and it should be a beautiful word, but Jews themselves have wondered how you can say the word. If you use the wrong tone of voice, it's a slur ... It shouldn't be that way. I'm interested in cutting off the associative baggage around it ...''Is Malkmus Jewish?'' No he's not, but in his nature, he's the most Jewish WASP I've ever known ...''Do you think the Jewish male has been emasculated by American society?''You mean- what's that guy, I hate that TV show, Mad About You. ''Paul Reiser?'' Yeah. If he's the candidate, then it's true. ''Do you see yourself as providing any counterpoint to that emasculation?'' No. I'm not trying to be a Jewish male, but I do feel like we could use some more linebackers and cowboys. But there's a lot of Jewish mama's boys out there. it's the way they're raised, and that accounts for a lot of the things about Jewish culture, so you can't really take it away. ''Did you observe the high holy days?'' I was high. OCT 14-20, 1998 - NYMPRESS ARTS & LISTINGS - 21"

  "title": "Ushering in The Silver Age - from Dolomite magazine",
  "body": "David Berman is Ushering in The Silver Ageby Charles Austin, February 18, 1999David Berman may have come to your attention as the singer/ lyricist in the Silver Jews. He also writes prose and poetry (he's been working on a long poem called 'Cantos for James Michener' for years). The third and most recent full-length Silver Jews record, 'American Water', reeks of substance, humour and intelligence. Berman is getting some serious attention in both the States and England as a songwriter of the highest order whose work is outside the 'Smashy Pumpky' zeigeist of self-pity and cynicism, and he is challenging the status quo depiction of our generational outlook as bleak and whiny. When we spoke to him, he was hanging out in Chicago, getting the cover together for a book of his poetry, 'Actual Air', to be be published by Open City Press in New York. Berman is especially pleased that the forthcoming book will appear with glowing reviews on the back cover by two of his favourite poets, James Tate and Billy Collins. A generous and witty conversationalist, Berman described his involvement in writing and music with the same kind of tangential logic and imagination that characterize his lyrics. '''Songwriting''' \"I was trying to write this song the other day and I really wanted it to be based on the idea of \"Let's not and say we did\". Then it turned out that I had to get rid of that whole structure, but it was the determining structure. I had to get rid of the title and even take the line out. The seed that bore the structure was removed later, and it became a completely different song. What you're trying to do is find something that works, even if you have to kill your little darlings on the way. '''Video Games and the Inner Landscape''' \"I find in my music I'm not pushing ahead like some other bands whose process seems to be more vertical, mine is more horizontal. I have found a territory I am interested in and now I'm moving to the side and looking around. \"It's almost like when you are a little kid and you get on a video game and you think if you kept moving to the side that the landscape would change, but it would be actually be very repetitive, but you'd think that you could travel infinitely and maybe there would be some kind of aberration in the landscape, like a lake, that wasn't there in the other frame. Hopefully you're not just going over the same landscape. It really is a process for me of moving to the side, and I do feel that you can keep moving to the left and the right infinitely. '''Coincidences''' \"[One of Berman's own poems], Democratic Vistas, kept surprising me with coincidences. I took the title of the poem from the title of a Walt Whitman essay. I always liked the title, then I thought \"Isn't it funny\", because in a sense, a sniper on a rooftop has a democratic vista. He has a view of people on the street and they are all equal potential targets. And later I realized that when I was thinking of the sniper, I was thinking of a particular sniper --- one that was on a tower at the University of Texas in the early 1960's. I think he killed about ten people. I didn't realize until much later until after the poem was written that his name was Charles Whitman. Little things like that kept opening up. I was getting surprised at the same time a reader might be surprised in the process of reading the poem. That keeps me interested. '''On Not Playing Live and Selling Records''' \"I always want to try to find a medium between not demanding any attention and not refusing to give it back. I've never turned down an interview. When people say \"Why don't you play live, are you trying to create this mysterious aura?\", I say \"No, it's much simpler than that, I have a life that is separate from the music and I like to keep it that way\". I come around and make record every two years and I hope that people like it. The idea of playing live to me seems like asking for more. People pay for the record and I'm not going to ask them to pay for anything else. I don't think the live shows are going to be good and I would never sell anything that isn't going to be good. When it happens, it's got to have a purpose. It's not to sell records. '''Permission to be Prolific''' \"I'm always conscious that I need to keep songs flowing. I'm trying to write even faster now. I've never had the full-on confidence that gives me the permission to be prolific. I'm sort of artificially giving it to myself now. This is a new strategy. I'm behaving as if what I'm doing is important, and by that I hope that it will actually become so. I'm trying to get further away from sense. In the new songs, I'm trying to throw meaning out the window, and let a new kind of alien meaning come in through the other window. One song ('Like like the the the Death') seems to promise sense, but it has to be constructed in your own mind if it's to be there at all. You could say that it's phrased and presented as if I was saying something as logical as the Declaration of Independence. It's stated casually, it's not announcing itself as \"Hey, isn't this weird\". '''Effortlessness''' \"I'm definitely not the type who can open up the faucet and let the words flow out. I struggle to get it out and what may appear to be stream of consciousness, which is the look of an effortless expelling of words has a lot of effort behind it. But it doesn't matter if it's known or not. In fact when something's written well, it has the illusion of effortlessness. If you read a Raymond Carver story, he went over it with a fine tooth comb a hundred times to get the illusion of effortlessness. '''Aging Rockers''' \"It's always a question of rock musicians, \"Why are their productive careers so short?\". I haven't read a really good explanation of it. Compared to other careers, it's pretty short, and I'd like to avoid that trap if I could. \"I think to the degree that your music is dependent on an adolescent energy, you're probably risking having your career end early because once that energy is gone, once it's out of your body and out of your mind, then your source material is gone. That leaves an Iggy Pop or whoever, bereft of ideas after awhile. \"As for the guys who wrote music for adults, it doesn't seem any more ridiculous for Charlie Rich or Jerry Lee Lewis or even Nick Cave, when you see a video of one of them performing at thirty versus fifty, they seem equally valid, although you can't say the same of Mick Jagger. Because they never made any bones about that they were making adult music, they weren't trying to sell it to the kids, or at least that wasn't their only focus. '''It's Getting Better''' \"When I was in my 20's I used to read a lot of American 80's fiction: Tobias Wolff, Raymond Carver, etc. In a lot of ways I felt that it was preparation for me for my adulthood, for my thirties, my forties; these novels and short stories about adult men, alcoholism, divorce... I thought 'At least I'll know what my options are and how to behave, I've read so much about it.' There's been moments where I felt aging was a process of decay, but the last few years have been the best of my life, and it seems to get better."

  "title": "David Berman - from Frequency Magazine's 1st issue",
  "body": "By Spencer Mindell'''I heard you were going to do a Peel Session''' -Yeah, I was supposed to, but that didn't work out. '''Just bad timing?''' -I went over a month ago and did all this stuff and while I was there it wasn't time and I wasn't in the mood to play guitar. It was sort of an issue of whether it was the right thing to do or not. So we didn't do it anyway. '''Were you going to do it by yourself or with a band?''' -I was going to do it by myself. I rarely want to play in front of other people. Every once in a while I get it in my mind that I will. It's just as likely that I'll change my mind on the day. '''Do you think you'll come around to it some day?''' -I guess it doesn't seem (Peel Sessions), you know, the name is important. When you think about it it just sounds good: \"Ah yeah, we got a Peel Session under our belt\". But what is it? Just another recording that's done quicker. You either do a version of an old song in a new way or you do maybe a new song. I don't know, i guess it would be nice to say that I had a Peel Session. '''I've been reading your stuff in the Baffler over the last year and a half. In the last issue (Winter 96) there was an excerpt from your longer project, \"Cantos for James Michener\". How's that going?''' -It was going really good. I took a break from it for a while. It's fun. For some reason, it's really fun to write. But I have not been working on that since August. It's something I want to finish. I'd like to keep it separate from the other things, like if I could have a book of just those, that would be real great. '''If the day ever came, how would you go about getting it out? Would it be just a small printing thing?''' -Every time I think about publishing a book I'm pretty sure that I would wait, if i could, to get it on a big press. It's important for me, for the writing, not to get buried somewhere. So I would wait. Even if I was fifty, if that's how long it would take to be able to publish it somewhere where it would get out. I would never give it to whatever the Drag City equivalent in the publishing industry. '''I read your piece on the back of the Scud Mountain Boys' Pine Box LP. Have you ever thought about just throwing in some of your writing with, say, your next release?''' -That would be cool. But I want to keep them separate. You know a couple of months ago I went over to England to do these readings and I felt later that that was a mistake even though I had fun. I lost sight of my original vision which was that I would keep the music and the writing separate. I think they diminish each other. If you're a musician and people know you as a musician and hear that you are a writer, they think its just something your dabbling in. On the other side, if people are in the literary community and they find out you're a musician, they diminish each other. People don't take it seriously. It becomes something like: \"Oh, this is his hobby. It's something he does to pass the time.\" They sense there is a lack of commitment in it, or something. So if I ever had a book I would never write on the back of it, you know, member of a band. '''So do you occupy your in between time with writing? What's between writing and recording?''' -I take it as it goes. I can sense what i should be doing any particular week or month. Sometimes I need to have that emotional expression that music gives me, other times I want to shut that down. I think the kind of writing that I do is less true to my life and less of an outlet for biographical description. So if i want to close that part of myself up, just block that tunnel to the outside world out, then I'll write. You've got to just take your psychological temperature once in a while. You just know when you wake up in the morning whether to pick up a pen or play a guitar. '''Or drop out of school. But that's me. You were doing graduate studies...''' -Yeah, I was. I was at the University of Massachusetts for a while getting my M.F.A. and it was something that when I was about 24 I applied to this program because I was really enamored with this writer up there named James Tate. I wanted to just learn from him. To do that I got into this M.F.A. program and Found out I could go up there for three years and not work. It was great. That's what I did. I was able to write songs without having to have a job. It was a great time. I didn't go up there to get a degree. I haven't used it in any way. It was more of an opportunity to kill time. '''So that was in Northampton right?''' -Yes '''Is that where you hooked up with New Radiant Storm King and the Scud Mountain Boys?''' -That's where I met them. The singer from the Scud Mountain Boys was also in that same writing program. '''A few recording sessions went into this newer album. You had a bit of trouble finding the right sound. Did you use the same songs? Were you trying to find the right sound with the same songs, or did you switch it all around?''' -I rewrote some songs and I discarded some songs. It was finding the write feeling , you know. I had a hard time. I went to record the record and i could not concentrate. I couldn't really figure out what i was doing, you know, going through the motions. Well, it's a year later and it's time to record another record. I always have a backlog of songs. There's like ten or twelve and I'll cut out everything after that. I had some songs and I thought, well, they just needed to be recorded. I hadn't really thought that you had to be in the right frame of mind.And when I realized I wasn't, I just needed to go home and be disappointed in myself. I had to go back and say \"Well, what the fuck are you going?\" and remind myself that the reason to record; what the point is. I remember it was because I wanted to speak to people. Eight months later I went and recorded again. I asked some new people, partly out of just embarrassment. I didn't want to obligate people to follow me into what could be another failure. '''Why did you record the new album in Connecticut of all places? Were you living in Northampton at the time?''' -Well, no. I had been living in Virginia for about a year and a half. I knew a friend who worked at the studio, said it was professionally equipped for the money. You could stay there if you wanted to. I sort of had a fascination with Hartford, having never been there, as one of those mysterious business cities on the East Coast. Like Bloomington, Delaware. '''Like a Mandatory City.''' -Yeah. Visiting it cured me. '''I noticed on the new album you have an emphasis on certain words. Do you have little thoughts that fall onto the paper subconsciously?''' -I almost never sit down to write about anything. I try to let myself surprise myself. I try to pick the things that are surprising but seem inevitable. They're not just strange for strangeness sake. They are just certain themes that are running through my life at a certain period. Someone asked me why the word cum shows up three times. Those songs that were written about two years ago, I had gone back to visit this elementary school that I went to for a couple years when I was a kid. I was just walking down the halls, and the one thing that struck me, as I was just walking down the halls, was the word cumbucket, which people used to throw around alot. It was a word that would just stick in my head as I walked home from school, repeating it over and over again: Cumbucket. I like the way it sounded. And I liked the particular image of this bucket of cum with it slopping over the sides. It just reactivated that word for me. Then I was in Europe, walking by this ladies clothing store in Vienna. It was called \"Cum\" and it was a very classy store right in the middle of an expensive neighborhood. So I took a photo of it. It just kept coming around. '''Back to where you went to High School...was that in Texas?''' -Well, I was born in Virginia and grew up here (Virginia). We moved to Central Ohio for a while and then I moved to Dallas. '''That's pretty random.''' -It was good for me. I never really felt home. I never was comfortable enough to become wallpaper. '''You were seen at the Drag City booth at the Indie Rock Flea Market in Charlottesville this summer drawing profiles of people.''' -Dan (Koretsky) and Ryan (Murphy) from Drag City had come for this flea market. I went with them, but I didn't really have a function. Dan had the idea that we could make some spare change by doing these drawing for 2$. It was great for me, because I like to draw, and the more I do it, the better I get. By the end of the day, it seemed I was drawing better than I ever had. It seemed like people were getting off on it. I was trying not to make them too insulting. '''Do you help out with Drag City much? Do You work with other people on the label?''' -Sometimes, a little bit. Just now when you called I was writing descriptions for the new catalog. Its sort of fun, so I'm just doing a couple descriptions for each record. '''And you can't avoid the inevitable Silver Palace question. Is anything going to come out or does it remain a really good idea to work with?''' -No, I don't think anything is going to come out of it. It seems like a good idea but at a certain point , the reality of a collaboration is always more disappointing than you want it to be. I can't think of any collaborations that were any better than the people who collaborated's individual work. I don't think think it would mix very well. But it was a good idea. '''Are you still writing songs for other bands, or other people?''' -Yeah. There's a guy who lives here, an old friend of mine, Gate Pratt, who I write songs for. He usually plays about once every other week at this local club. About once a month he'll play a song that I wrote for him. But he's about it right now. '''Are you aware of your presence on the World Wide Web? Have you come across Scott Caligan's Joo's page, \"The Reef\"?''' -I am actually. My girlfriend saw it. She works at the library at the university. I don't know how she found it but she showed it to me and it was great. I was really happy about it. I didn't know that anyone had gone to that kind of trouble. '''Why don't you put out 7\"s anymore? There hasn't been one since your split with New Radiant Storm King and that was 94.''' -I was just thinking about those the other day. Actually, I don't like 7\"s anymore, though I don't know why. For some reason they just seem so disposable. I can't imagine ever putting out another 7\" ever again. There is just so many of them. It just seems like a guaranteed way of burying your music unless you have some intention of putting out a collection of 7\"'s on a CD. I don't know. It's funny you ask that because i was just thinking about that the other day. Why am I so turned off by 7\"s? Even when I get one I don't really want to listen to it. I'm so disappointed in them as a format. Its ineffable, I cannot explain why. I used to live for them and love them. For a couple years all I bought were 7\"'s. '''From your first 7\", The Dime Map of the Reef, to now, at what point between did you decide to go to the studio?''' -I guess the Dime Map and the Arizona Record were all recorded at the same time, but released a year apart. So when we went to do Starlite Walker it had been two years since we recorded that stuff. In that two years there really didn't seem to be any question that recording outside a studio; with the sounds that we could get with our skill level on a four track or tape recorder, were not good enough. It didn't seem to appeal to us. We had done that. It was fun for a while. We recorded alot of stuff on four-track that's sort of in between the quality of the Arizona Record and Starlite Walker that was never really released. It was just time to do it. As far as we knew, we were just going to make one other record and that would be it, and we wanted to do it for real. '''It was a good choice. Even though there was alot of good, buried stuff on the seven inches and the EP, the studio manages to bring the sounds to light.''' -I liked that early stuff, but it had it's place and its time. '''What about playing live? From what I have heard, you've played live twice.''' -In the Silver Joo's we've played live (1..2..) three times. We played live as the War Comet once. And then in college I played live about 10 or fifteen times. '''With Ectoslavia back in the days?'''-Yeah. '''I heard those (Ectoslavia) songs on the Challenged Landscape Compilation. Interesting stuff. Very sonic.''' -Yeah. That's what it was. We would just play around here (Charlottesville) and in Richmond. We even played Blacksburg once or twice. It was just a bunch of noise. But yeah, I haven't played live in about three years now. '''I guess you don't much plan on it?''' -No '''I've heard you don't like playing songs once they've been recorded?''' -That's part of it but that's a small reason. I just don't. It's not true to myself. It's not who I am. I am not the type of person that plays live. I'm not performer. '''I guess its giving yourself.''' -I just don't feel comfortable on a stage. I could do it but it would have to fake my way through it. I don't want to adopt a pose which is what I would have to do. '''Pleasing fans that were expecting to be pleased.''' -Yeah. It's just something I don't really plan to do. I used to say 'Yeah, in the future once I get over my hang up\". But then i realized my perspective on playing live is perfectly okay. It's just that people used to try and convince me that there was something wrong with the way I was looking at it. But then I realized, no, that it was just not right for me. '''What's the deal with Frank Black? Is there truth to that story or was that just a play around?''' -No that was a true story actually. They wrote an article about it in Melody Maker which is pretty much true. The only thing was that maybe they exaggerated. I didn't get arrested. I got detained by the police but was never arrested. '''I take it you were a big fan of Frank Black and the Pixies.''' -I was at one point. I wasn't a fan of his but when I went to him to ask him to record...It's sort of like I'm not a big fan of what Paul Leary does in the Butthole Surfers anymore. I was a big fan at one time and I would like to have him produce something because I think that if I don't like the way he writes songs anymore, I still believe in the way his songs sound. The way he made his songs sound at a time. So I would ask someone to produce a Silver Jew's record who's music I didn't necessarily respect anymore. I don't think I would ask someone to play on a record if I felt that way. '''Couldn't much imagine Frank Black playing on a Silver Jew's record. Eight vocal track overdubs would be kind of funny sounding.''' -Yeah. '''I've never noticed production as a focal point or even much of a deal at all beyond your jump from home recording to studio.''' -It isn't. Mainly because I don't know anything about it. Sometimes I have been tempted to work with someone who could translate certain metaphorical idea's, descriptions of how i would like to sound, who could do what I wanted. Luckily, the people who I have just accidentally worked with, whether it was the engineers at the two studios, they've been able to do that. But I was never sure of that when I went in. Whether they would enforce a sound on the record that I couldn't prevent because I didn't have the words to describe what I wanted. '''Bridging Technicalities with Ideas.''' -Yeah. If I could get Paul Leary to produce, which I could never afford, and be able to explain why certain things sound, why things on \"Hairway to Steaven\" appeal to me so much. He could explain to me why they sound that way, and I would learn. I could hopefully steal some of that because I think that is one of the best sounding records I have ever heard. '''What's happening next?''' -Every time I finish a record, when I'm done, my feeling is : That's it, I don't want to do it anymore. Not out of disgust or anything but feeling rather, okay, I've said my piece. And that's where I am right now. It always remains to be seen whether a couple of months down the road I'll change my mind. I mean I have songs and I don't want them to just disappear or never get used. I don't know what will happen to them. '''Maybe you could lend them out.''' -Yeah, but at the place I am now, I'm not even at the planning stage. I'm just sort of thinking that I've done something and I'm not sure if I'll make anymore records. '''It would be a shame if you stopped. At least from here.''' -We'll see. I'll have to wait, probably until springtime whether I'll know for sure whether I'm gonna make another record. '''When you put a song together, what do you put an emphasis on first? Is it the guitar or the words? On the new album I notice the strum as the backbone of the entire album.''' -Music always comes first when the song is written. Then I just put the words on top of it. '''What kind of books have been occupying your eyes of late.''' -I read alot of books. Right now I am reading a book called the \"Western Cannon\" by Harold Bloom. It's a book of literary criticism in a way, but he's just talking about his version of what the literary cannon would be. I just read this book of short stories by Gary Lutz called \"Stories in the Worst Way\" which really blew me away. I read alot of mostly fiction, short stories. John Ashbery, he's a poet I really love, I've been finishing alot of his stuff and he's got around 16 or 17 books. I read alot of biographies. Just anything. I read around two or three good books a week. '''I'm stuck reading two or three books worth of bad turns in Canadian literature.''' -I don't even know...what is Canadian Literature? '''Nothing. Margaret Atwood. I don't know how much it exists. (blah-here) Have you ever been out to the west cost? Only because aspects of your music seem timeless, but over on the Westcoast everything seems like contemporary slop.'''-I think about it alot. I really want to go. I'd love to see L.A. and spend some time there. I'd like to find out what it is about it that repulses people. Anything that can stir up such strong reactions I'm gonna wanna go and see for myself. I wanna see it before it falls in the ocean. '''I've always thought it would implode. There's no other means to an end to L.A. - I haven't seen a Baffler around for about 6 months now. Is that pretty much done with?''' -No. I don't really stay in much touch with them. They call. They haven't called since that last time you mentioned. I don't know if they didn't want anything or whether they just haven't gotten around to do another issue. '''Is your writing anywhere else around?''' -There is another journal in New York called \"Open City\" that I gave some pieces to. But not really anything else though that I can think of off the top of my head. '''I just had a scary vision of opening up a Harper's one day and seeing a piece about the H3NO4 Indians.''' -That'd be good. '''You did a piece called \"The History of the Silver Jews\" and near the end there was a line ... \"If your lucky you might find two sweat bees fucking on a coke mirror\". Where does it come from?''' -I don't know. Like I said, it surprises me sometimes. It just pops out. You might just be sitting around. I have a little mirror you get at a county fair with a picture of Led Zeppelin, the guy with the wings that's always on the label on the inside of the record. You might just be thinking about doing lines on it and then a bee might knock against the window. You never know. It's just a process of basic, unlikely things. You know, putting them together. '''It's refreshing. So much stuff written has been written before, and reading your stuff it's nice to see some people with their own. --- Now I emailed Dan at Drag City and he wrote that he has kept copies of your live performance at the 1993 Drag City Invitational (in Chicago) under wraps and might one day release them. Would you be OK with that?''' -Yeah. Some of the songs came out good. As a whole show I don't think it would sound good. But there's a couple of the songs on there that would work as releases. '''Were there songs not released before?''' -A cover song we did. Cocksucker Blue's by the Stone's. And the Walnut Falcon from our first seven inch. Those two songs you could rescue from that tape and release. '''Too bad it would only go on a 7\" and I suppose there is no home for that.'''"

  "title": "The Aquarium Drunkard Interview Part 1 & 2",
  "body": "== Part 1 ==Earlier this week Aquarium Drunkard caught up with Silver Jews’ David Berman whose new album Lookout Mountain, Lookout Sea (the Joos sixth LP) drops June 17th via the Drag City label. Here, in part one of the interview, Berman discusses his faith, recovery, the documentary film Silver Jew, songwriting and his fairly recent role as bandleader in a live setting after years of non-touring, and what effect that has on one’s creative process. Stay tuned for part two of the interview which digs into the new LP and more.---Aquarium Drunkard: What made you decide to go on tour for the last couple of albums after so much silence? In a Pop Matters interview, you listed your reasons for going as “1) I’m on a mission from G-d and 2) I’m not joking.” Can you elaborate on that? Are your reasons still the same?David Berman: I was the hedgehog and not the fox the day I did that interview. Maybe I should list all the reasons at once. Perhaps the most interesting one I don’t talk about, is the way it helped me put a second act of my life into play. Intentionally or not, I was able to enter a sort of mythic structure through which I could keep growing and survive. I think I was so stuck in life, I needed to find a heroic narrative for myself. There it was, ready-made and waiting and one day I just realized “hey I’ve got an idea for an odyssey!”Sometimes the album cover art looks like a good parody of this, my midlife idealism.Aquarium Drunkard: As someone who had never toured before, you had the benefit of being more grown-up, more mature your first time on the road. How was the experience?David Berman: I like it fine. The driving is too much. I’d rather travel by ambulance. And I like doing the shows and signing records. I’m generally open or open to being open, but I shutdown and get real quiet around other bands.AD: What was it like playing in Israel? Do you know Hebrew?DB: I would rate the sunlight there as the best I’d ever seen or felt and I want to go back as soon as I’m invited again. So far no secretworldwidezionistentertainment councils have contacted me. My Hebrew is hardly there.AD: In the film Silver Jew, you tell a group of Israeli fans that, because you’d never toured before, you’d never had the experience of making someone happy. Judging by your reaction to the kids, and their reaction to you, I’m guessing that this had a pretty big effect on you both as an artist and a human being. Can you talk about that at all? Do you think that things would have turned out differently had you been able to judge fan reaction from the get-go?DB: Fan reaction is so out-sized and hyperbolic in rock music compared to other arts. I don’t think any songwriter who comes up through playing clubs can really claim to have independently developed their art. All along the way so much information is coming, the writer inside the performer unconsciously reacts to all of that. By the time they get to be thirty, the writer is gone. I’m glad I did it this way. I taught myself to write without applause for a long time. This is the first post-applause album I’ve done. Maybe that accounts for what’s so different about it.AD: I want to ask you a few questions about Silver Jew and your experiences that surround the film. Early on, when discussing the origins of the band’s name, you talk about how for the first fifteen years, the name – the moniker, really, of “Jew” – was something of a millstone around your neck. What did you mean by that?DB: I meant that as a poet I loved the name Silver Jews but you have to remember how politically correct things were in the nineties. People in Northampton, Massachusetts and New York looked for meaning in it when I claimed none. It could have been my imagination, but I know it wasn’t.AD: Did you grow up in a Jewish home?DB: No. My great grandfather was the last practicing Jew in my family. He died in 1982.AD: How did you become re-interested in your faith? Was there a single moment of epiphany or was it a gradual unveiling over time?DB: Over time. I always had a background belief in God. In other words, instinctually I’ve never doubted that we are not alone. I think I fell out of love with art, or came to the end of my adventure with it, and beyond that I found a body of work to be studied that was immense and exciting in ways that literature or scripted cable TV series cannot be for me anymore.AD: On earlier tracks, like “Like Like The The The Death” from American Water, how much of the spiritual questioning and yearning is your own? For instance, in “Send in the Clouds,” you sing “My momma named me after a king / I’m gonna bury my name in you.” The obvious conclusion is that you’re singing about King David, who is, if my biblical knowledge serves me well, considered something of the Alpha Jew behind Moses and the prophets.DB: That’s right . Back then I thought of Jewishness as something like my left-handedness. I also was employing the Jewish way of making the everyday sacred without knowing it, by transforming the very common name David, into something dominant and regal.AD: Tell me about your trip to the West Wall; your reaction while reading and praying seems to come on very suddenly. Obviously, the Wall is a very holy place in the Jewish faith; what were your feelings while approaching it and while praying? What passage were you reading at the Wall?DB: I was reading the Shema. It’s something Jews say three times a day. The best is if you can die with it “on your lips”. I was taken pretty unaware. The Shema is a vow that I have never taken all the way. It’s words resonate all the way down to my bones. Maybe because I resist following their instructions.AD: I read an interview with you where you referenced William Bowers’ Village Voice piece wherein he says something about how disarming it is to see you cry in the film. He goes on to say that it’s equally jarring to see someone “with such a sharp mind speaking so hippie-ly about receiving universal answers,” as if it’s impossible to both have an active mind and be a believer in anything. Have you experienced any other befuddlement of this sort since you’ve been more public about your faith?DB: Well there is a kind of hysterical atheism I’ve noticed lately coming out of people. I don’t know if people want to hear this, but Judaism is not harmful to human life its daughter religions that claim one true way. Jews would be surprised to find out how truly kind and wise their own religion is. Since they don’t proselytize, and historically keep to themselves, where are you going to hear about it? Only insiders know.AD: Israel was obviously a very emotionally challenging time for you, between the emotional rush of the tour itself, where you yourself were in life, and having discovered your faith, and it was all under the gaze of video cameras. So you went from this semi-seclusion as a non-touring artist to all of this exposure in an intense, emotionally naked moment, though you seemed to handle it really well.DB: It helps that I’ve never seen the film. I had some friends watch it for me and evaluate it. I was on the fence about it for a long time but when I heard about the crying at the wall I knew I wanted to let it go out. I like curve balls but I don’t get to throw them much. Releasing thatSeemed a little more audacious than adding bagpipes to a song, and so it redeemed the idea of releasing it at all.AD: One of my favorite things about the film is watching you and your wife Cassie interact. She looks so proud of you throughout the film, and the love that you guys have for each other comes across as genuine. How did the trip affect her as someone coming from a non-Jewish background? It seems to have ultimately tied you guys closer together, which is a beautiful thing.DB: Cassie and I are so close together that we protect our little territories of difference. She got a blackberry phone yesterday. To me that is mortifying. She can’t stop loving the Virgin Mary. The V.M. reminds me of butchery.AD: To what degree was she involved in your recovery? She seems as though she takes good care of you, and there’s that other famous Nashville singer/film subject whose wife helped him through his problem…DB: She was very involved. She read all the same books I did. She had to stop drinking like she was taught to in Louisville. I dragged her through some nasty awful places. - words/marty garner== Part 2 ==There is an alternate Nashville in another universe where everything works the way it was supposed to, one where Willie Nelson was never forced to move back to Texas and the current crop of country superstars pay more than lip service to the dark genius of the Louvin Brothers and Porter Wagoner. In this Nashville, there is a new king whose presence looms large over Lower Broadway. His songs are sung through dripping spit by every down n dirty drunk who made it out of Little Rock only to land in Tootsie’s Orchid Lounge; his words of praise dot hymnals in the carnival shadows of the Ryman’s stained glass. This king is David Berman.If you were to stand on a dark Opry stage back in 1946 with Mother Maybelle Carter and stare into country music’s future, Berman’s are the tired eyes you’d see staring back. This is what country music was supposed to be, all dark and dense and honest. You can hear it in the straining gospel of the Carters and in the loaded-repent-repeat lives of Johnny, Willie, and Kris. If country music’s sad, it’s only because country musicians are honest; Jean-Paul Sartre had nothing on Waylon Jennings. Only later, sometime in the late 70s maybe, did Nashville trade in its soul for a rhinestone saddle.And so this is where the Silver Jew finds himself, riding the dark horse through the city of gloss….---Aquarium Drunkard: Let’s shift now to Lookout Mountain, Lookout Sea. Tell me about the song “Suffering Jukebox.” Coming from someone who has always been so loath to tour, it’s easy to read a line like “Suffering Jukebox, such a sad machine/You’re all filled up with what other people mean/And they never seem to turn you up loud/Gotta lotta chatterboxes in this town” as a complaint from the stage.David Berman: Well it wouldn’t be me. I get to sing what I mean, and get turned up loud and it seems the people who come to Silver Jews shows are the type that really pays attention to what’s being said. I guess I’m commiserating with my opposite, which means the guys who play in the bars on Lower Broad, playing country classics. The ones who don’t get to tour, who are stuck playing for tips, even know they can play a thousand times better than me.AD: What about “My Pillow is the Threshold;” while the lyrics in the chorus are theoretically positive, the tremoloed guitars seem to suggest otherwise, almost as if entering a relationship with someone who’s going to truly know you is more terrifying than it’s worth. In essence, it captures the push-pull of wanting to be known versus fear of actually being known.DB: The wording is calmer, much calmer that the music. Because the narrator doesn’t register the tenor of emergency in the music. There is some anxiety, he must be deranged or intent on perishing.AD: “Open Field” was written by Maher Shalal Hash Baz, aka Tori Kudo. Can you tell me about the song? How did you come across the track, which – lyrically speaking – is very dissimilar to your work, and what led you to record it?DB: I got a few Maher records in the mail from Stephen Pastel a couple of years ago and that song really impressed me. The minimalism. I was thinking about the squirrels in Strange Victory. It would be nice if they had somewhere to scamper off into after the song was over.How can I put a meadow or a field in the album?AD: “Strange Victory Strange Defeat” begins with (and is inspired by) a clip of Teddy Roosevelt saying, “In other words, don’t flinch, don’t fall, and hit the line hard.” Where did you come across the clip? I think it’s particularly interesting that this song, which criticizes the way that music has evolved aesthetically, sounds more than a little like the Arcade Fire.DB: The clip is from a box set of American Oratory. The chorus has some rhetorical heft but I was worried it would sound striving like a Soul Asylum anthem. As a counterpoint I thought the verses should sound somewhat equaniminous.AD: Lookout Mountain, Lookout Sea has a more hopeful feel to it. Even a song like “Suffering Jukebox” lacks the despair that colors some of your earlier work. You, the singer, seem less wrapped up in the proceedings here, as if you’re just the reporter, a reporter who sympathizes with and understands his story without actually being a part of it.DB: I think that has to do with re-adjustments I made after touring. Touring really straightened my aim out and recalibrated my shtick, I think.AD: The new album is dedicated to the artist Jeremy Blake, whose story received a great deal of media attention last year. To what extent did you know him? Given what you had been through by the time Jeremy passed away, is this record a sort-of monument to having come through the other side?DB: He was a good friend and a good friend to me. He was also a tremendous fan of my work and really encouraged me on my road back. Jeremy’s problem wasn’t chemical but it was madness and in a lot of ways I see him as a harbinger of what we as a society have waiting for us when we finally finish shopping.AD: You recorded the LP with your touring band from 2006, which makes them the longest consecutive incarnation of the Silver Jews. How did that familiarity help the recording process?DB: It was a factor in the practicing and the basic tracking. This is a band compiled out of the past bands. Everyone on this record has played on at least one other.AD: You’ve said that touring made you realize how young your audience is, and that that has enabled you as a writer to think a bit more clearly on what it is you’re trying to say. Do you feel a greater sense of responsibility as an artist, knowing how captive your audience is and, perhaps, the effect that your words can have on them?DB: Definitely. I’m not going to be anyone’s Jim Jones!AD: There is that classic struggle in art of whether you’re creating for yourself or for your audience. If you are creating for yourself alone, you run the risk of leading people down a path that you may not want to. If you create for the audience alone, you run the risk of no longer being true to yourself. How do you toe that line?DB: You create for a composite audience of people you care about, people you respect. It’s something you do mentally as you go along.AD: Self-honesty seems to be an overwhelming theme of yours, which is a rare commodity in an age of hyper-irony and the general posturing that people in the underground music world self-apply. Honesty, though, is an emotionally rough trade; do you find it hard to remain honest with yourself and your audience?DB: Honestly, strict honesty from an artist only clarifies about 10% of the illusions and delusions we carry around about them. Because the artist knows the audience doesn’t want to know.If you break down to much of the fantasy you do harm to the experience of the music. It would be dishonest for me to claim honestyAD: At one point in that Village Voice piece, you’re talking about being a writer, and your style, and how your music demands people to pay it closer mind than, say, My Morning Jacket’s or the Flaming Lips’, whom you can put on and let fade back and it just sounds good. How does being a trained poet affect the way that you look at music? Are there any younger songwriters today whose lyrics you enjoy?DB: In the eighties they had this really corny tag for music like X and the Clash: “music that matters.” No one wanted to call it new wave. No one said “post-punk” yet. “Alternative” and “progressive” were unusable.I still think in these terms though. Music should individuate the musician. It should mean. It has to matter. But we are full up with messengers who have forgotten the message and there really isn’t any vocal resistance to the problem. There are no critics willing to rain on the parade in 2008. I don’t think the system permits this criticism.Young songwriters? I like the young man in Cajun Dance Party. Daniel Blumberg. Cass McCombs is good. There’s a James Toth record coming out on Rykodisc that is excellent.AD: I’ve read that you started out by making up songs on the spot and singing them into Sonic Youth’s answering machine. Now, though, the lyrics to your songs seem to be much more carefully crafted. At what point did you start putting more craft into your songwriting?DB: Yes it went from improvisation to composition and revision in the spring and summer of 1994. I had spent the preceding two years reading and writing poems.AD: Do you plan on releasing any more books of poetry? (ed. Berman’s “Actual Air”)DB: Harper Lee only wrote “To Kill A Mockingbird.” I like the idea of one book better than only having one.AD: To what degree do you consider yourself a country musician? You obviously don’t fit into the contemporary Nashville mold, which is a nice thing, but where do you see yourself in the grand tradition of Nashville singer/songwriters? Which of the “old guard” do you feel the most kindred to?DB: Since I’ve lived here lots of legends have died. Hank Snow, Johnny Paycheck, Waylon Jennings, Grady Martin, and just recently Eddy Arnold. The singers have the country hall of fame, The songwriters have their own museum and the session players have theirs. The industry is divided into these job categories. That really keeps it different. I do all those jobs myself. Making a country album is like making a movie. But if you are looking at songwriters who’ve shared this zipcode the list of my favorites is long. One, Dennis Linde, just died. His last hit was “Goodbye Earl” for the Dixie Chicks. I love that song. He was like Shel Silverstein and John Prine and Roger Miller. The funny ones. That’s who I like. words/marty garner"

  "title": "Yes, Sub-Space is Colder - from C- Ville Weekly, 1-7 Oct 96",
  "body": "by Jo ClineMention Albemarle County resident David Berman among indie rock cognoscenti and you'll get instant recognition. But most people around here just say \"Isn't he that tall, cool guy?\"The Silver Jews is Berman's band, founded in 1990 when he shared a Hoboken apartment with Steve Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich, both erstwhile Charlottesvillians via UVA, and both better known as M.O.P.: Members of Pavement. Their music is pensive and tuneful, with no real pyrotechnics. It's almost folksy: simple music about important things which inspires you to sing along.Despite the differences from Pavement, the Silver Jews have been unfairly labeled a Pavement side project. That will change. The Jews' second full-length comes out today on Chicago's ultra-hip label Drag City. Called '''''The Natural Bridge''''', the album is chock full of Virginia references and Virginia moods, and the same gentle wit that made their first album, '''''Starlite Walker''''', a quiet triumph among the in-the-know.'''''Bridge''''' spawned gossip long before it was recorded: after a week of practice in Charlottesville last October, the Silver Jews returned to the same studio in Memphis where they'd done '''''Starlite'''''. But something wasn't quite right.\"I didn't feel like they were entering the songs the way I wanted them to,\" Berman explains. And, knowing he was costing lots of people time, money and inconvenience, he scrapped the sessions.Finally recorded in June at Studio .45 (an old Colt gun factory) in Hartford, Connecticut, '''''Bridge''''' features Peyton Pinkerton and Matt Hunter from New Radiant Storm King (with whom the Silver Jews released a split single in 1993), producer / drummer Rian Thomas Murphy, a Drag City fixture, and keyboardist Michael Deming.\"I needed people who understood the Silver Jews,\" Berman says, \"but didn't feel like they had to be in the band.\" This line-up change took some feather-smoothing on Berman's part, but he says that Malkmus and Nastanovich are still in the Silver Jews, and his next project will be with them.Many of the '''''Bridge''''' songs were written last winter, says Berman, \"when I was trapped in the house. All of them were written on cloudy days.\"He made tapes of the songs and sent demos to the other musicians a couple weeks before meeting to record. \"By the time we got to the studio,\" says Berman, \"they knew the songs better than I did.\"He describes the two weeks of recordings as kind of hellish because he had severe insomnia, so severe that he was having walking hallucinations and being \"constantly on the line with God,\" praying to be able to sleep again.One day driving to the studio, a tractor trailor truck from Guaranteed Overnight Delivery - G.O.D. - was parked perpendicular to the street, blocking their way, and he knew he wasn't going to get any sleep in Connecticut.The '''''Bridge''''' songs are populated with God, prayers, death, churches and even a hearse, but rather than gloom, '''''Bridge''''' invokes a kind of company for thought, a jumping off point for a pondering mood. More polished than '''''Starlite''''', '''''Bridge''''' music points to the lyrics.\"When I go downtown I always wear a corduroy suit / Cause it's made of a hundred gutters that the rain can run right through.\" - \"Black and Brown Blues\"\"In the cold places where Spanish is spoken / Most wars end in the fall.\" - \"Pet Politics\"The lyrics, Berman's deep soothing voice, and the pretty melodies team up to make the record a beautiful listen. Famous for trumping up reasons why he won't play live, Berman says he'll break down and do it within the next year (you heard it here). In the meantime, he's doing a spoken word tour in Europe, including a Peel Session. He sheepishly points to his own words in \"The Frontier Index\" to describe his situation: \"When I was younger I was a cobra / In every case I wanted to be cool / Now that I'm older and sub-space is colder / I just want to say something true.\""

  "title": "Meet the Silver Jews - from Addicted to Noise, Oct 96",
  "body": "by Chris NelsonAddicted To Noise Washington correspondent Chris Nelson reports: :Some people look at errors as bad things, as mistakes to be avoided. Not the Silver Jews' David Berman. He sees them as inspirational gold for the mining. In fact, sometimes he even tries to commit them. \"A lot of times, I'll see something and I'll get it wrong,\" explains Berman. \"I'll read a book sometimes really fast, or I'll open up to a page, purposely to allow a sentence to hit me wrong, and use the error to my favor.\"Berman is the songwriter, singer, and guitarist for the Silver Jews, whose second album, The Natural Bridge (Drag City) is due out this week. In the past many folks considered the Jews a sister band to Pavement, but that notion is likely to change with The Natural Bridge. Steven Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich, both members of Pavement and collaborators with Berman on other Silver Jews records, are nowhere to be found on the new album. Recording sessions with the two musicians did take place, but wound up being scrapped. Berman instead recruited Peyton Pinkerton (guitar), Matt Hunter (bass), and Rian Thomas Murphy (drums) to help him flesh out his new material. The Natural Bridge is an excellent country-folkish album stamped with Berman's poignant lyrics and keen eye for detail. Sample this born-of-error line, which begins a verse of \"Dallas\": \"We saw B.B. King on General Hospital in the Oak Cliff dramhouse where we stayed.\" \"I had a fever last winter,\" says Berman, noting the line's origins, \"and I was just sorta sitting there, flipping through the TV. I hit the end of General Hospital when they were showing the credits, and I guess B.B. King had been on the show. [But] I wasn't really sure if I had seen right...I don't really know if it was B.B. King or a guy named Bob King, or whatever.\" Whether King was actually on didn't matter, because what intrigued Berman was the contradictory picture he saw: \"The kind of misery on soap operas, and the kind of misery in the blues, and what kind of weird friction mix that would be--white, black, and everything.\" The title \"Inside the Golden Days of Missing You,\" a track whose melody and guitar work should conjure comparisons to the Velvet Underground, had a similar genesis. Last year, Berman's girlfriend was watching an episode of Saturday Night Live that featured a skit about a romance novelist. Berman was in an adjoining room and misheard the title of the novelist's book. So he walked in, and asked his girlfriend, \"Did he say The Golden Days of Missing You\"? And she said, \"The Golden Ache of Missing You,\" and I said, \"OK, that's mine then.\" Of course, this is only the stuff that Berman happens on by mistake. He's also a poet and short story writer who worked on (though he didn't complete) his master of fine arts degree at the University of Massachusetts. Suffice it to say that he also knows how to write the old-fashioned, purposeful, hard way. Cross The Natural Bridge and see for yourself."

  "title": "We'll Take the Lo Road - excerpts from an article",
  "body": "by Brad Lips, Option Magazine #59, NOV 94\"There's something special about recording at home,\" muses Dave Berman of the Silver Jews, a loosely configured \"band\" best known for including two members of Pavement. \"At home you get accidents. On our first 7-inch [Dime Map of the Reef], the second side has no drums for the first two minutes. But that's only because Bob Nastanovich wasn't home yet from his bus-driving job. So Steve Malkmus and I just started playing and then he came home, got a beer, popped it open, and then joined in. All of that is contained in the recording.\"Silver Jew Dave Berman feels observers miss the point when they peg lo-fi artists as lackadaisical and apathetic; their recording choice, he stresses, is a conscious reaction to the unwritten rules of the music biz. \"Why is it,\" Berman asks, \"that musicians are the only artists who have to travel to a fortress of machines to do their work?\"\"I wouldn't like everything to have poor production,\" says Dave Berman, \"but there are very few studio albums that can capture loneliness. There're exceptions, like Big Star's 3rd, but it's rare, because when everything's in a studio, you know that it's bankrolled by someone with business interests. When it's music by someone at home, it's an artifact from someone who, lacking money or connections or whatever, has no other outlet.\"Berman is quick to point out, however, that there's a \"romance of distance\" inherent in the pleasure of lo-fi recordings.excerpts from an article on the lo-fi music scene"

  "title": "Silver Jews, Naturally - from Melody Maker, 5th Oct 96",
  "body": "Silver Jews release a new album, \"The Natural Bridge\", on Domino on October 14 - and the advance tape has met with unanimous enthusiasm here at The Maker.On this occasion, leader David Berman is not joined by his regular partners Steve Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich, both also of Pavement, although the trio do intend to reunite for the next Silver Jews album. Berman explained: \"We went in and started to record, and after two days I realised that it didn't sound the way I wanted it to. It wasn't their fault, but they weren't able to interpret the songs in the way I wanted. So I waited a few months and decided to use some other people. I think I got the results I wanted.\"I guess when the last record came out, I was pleased that some people liked it, but I was a little disappointed that too much of the focus was on the fact that there were two members of Pavement on it. I had written all those songs. So I wanted to make a record by myself. \"But actually, I'm recording again soon with Steve and Bob.\"Berman is coming to Britain this week for for two live dates, at London Filthy McNasty's in Amwell Street, Islington, (October 2) and Glasgow John Smith's Bookshop (4).However, he'll be reading his short stories, lyrics and poems rather than playing music. \"I don't usually play live. I've always found it to be really unsatisfying,\" he told The Maker. \"When I write a song and record it, that's the song, and I don't like there to be two or three versions of it existing. After I've recorded it, I usually never play it again. \"I feel uncomfortable in the world of indie rock, but I'm realistic to know that that's where my music lands. I just have a lack of respect for the kind of music that's usually being made. I try to avoid having anything to do with that world, whether it means living out in the middle of nowhere where I do, or not playing in clubs where I would be totally sunk into that world. \"So I thought I would do some readings because it would give me the chance to meet the people who buy the records, because I always want to do that - I like talking to people - but not have to play to the rules of a rock world that I don't particularly respect.\" One of the highlights of the album is \"Dallas\", which tells the story of a traumatic episode from Berman's teenage years. \"I was at high school in Dallas, and my first girlfriend dumped me,\" he explained. I went into a severe depression, and my father insisted that I go to a psychiatrist. I thought it was pretty normal what I was going through, but my father saw it as something dark and dangerous. \"So he sent me to a psychiatrist who was an ordained Baptist minister, a race car driver and an ex-place kicker for an NFL football team. His best friend was John Oates, the dark-haired one of Hall & Oates. So I'd be sitting in there pouring my heart out to this guy, and there was this giant picture of John Oates over his desk! I gave me the creeps to be looking up at him, but it's an image that stuck with me. \"Although I've always done pretty good at what I've done in my life, I've always felt like I was fated to be in second place - like there was always a Daryl Hall over me, if only I could see who it was.\" Another song, \"Pet Politics\", \"came out of an art collaboration I did in Vienna with a friend of mine, a painter named Steve Keen [sic]. You had to write a biography for the show, and I had written some fictitious things. I wrote that in 1982 I had gone to the Falklands War and been a mercenary helicopter pilot for the Argentines. Even though I would have been 15 at the time, everyone there believed it, and I think there was a new-found respect for me because of it. \"Then I came home, and I started envisioning myself more as a war correspondent for a newspaper. I had just gotten a new dog called Jackson, and I imagined that he was with me in the Falklands and I lose him in the woods and I'm looking for him. The song kind of branched out from there.\" As well as the next Silver Jews album, Berman is currently looking forward to a possible collaboration with one Dave Matthews. \"The Dave Matthews Band are a Top 10 hippy band in America, like Hootie and the Blowfish. The guy lives in the same town as me, and one of my dreams is to record something with him, to see how that would sound. It would be very bizarre, I know.\""

  "body": "This will appear in Melody Maker at some point, in the Rebellious Jukebox slot, but it will be in a much edited form.Stephen Pastel is in normal text, ''David Keenan in italics''. At the ICA, London, lying on the floor...5. Bob Dylan \"Highway 61 Revisited\" / Silver Jews \"The Natural Bridge\"There's something about songs, such a great medium to express ideas within the limitations of the English language. People like Berman, there's just so much freshness in those words, it always sounds so new. I don't think Berman's like are that clever, in a way, they're beyond that. Silver Jews \"Natural Bridge\", there's probably not an equivalent record for me this year, maybe Smog's \"Red Apple Falls\", just a record I never get tired of and can play over and over, just enjoy. There's something pastoral and rural about the Silver Jews and sometimes I just want to really be a part of that, just open up to that gothic American tradition. I think they're a mythical, magic band.''The period of Dylan they make me think of is when he was up in Woodstock recording the Basement Tapes.''Yeah or \"Nashville Skyline\".''Getting back to the mythical America.''It's an America that's got a kind of...that `post' idea of America that makes you just want to travel the land. Everything you ever felt through Kerouac.''The skies''Y'know, just calling your album \"The Natural Bridge\"''It's difficult to talk about the Silver Jews in critical terms because, well, I know exactly what he means and what I feel about \"The Natural Bridge\" but I can't go any further towards elucidating it than that.''Berman's writing is really great cause on one hand he's always got this kind of `Olde Worlde' kind of thing. You can imagine him as some front line reporter trying to document the American civil war and at the same time there's something really `hip' about it. He's mixing that up with almost hip-hop kids dealing with each other. I love that and Dylan's like that, he's so fucking, his language is so hip but timeless also. Probably my favourite Dylan record is \"Highway 61 Revisited\"; \"Queen Jane Approximately\" is my favourite Dylan song. He can mix up lines of genuine profundity with nonsense but keep a consistency of mood, it's direct and it's unfathomable, really highbrow but also kind of pop. Back to the idea that we're trying to run through this intellectual high art thing. People are digging it and getting it.''Dylan always said \"I'm not a poet\", he's a performer, a rock musician, a folk artist, not a `poet', y'know? What Dylan did was expand the parameters of a nascent artform and when people see that they want to claim him for high art rather than allow him to validate this whole bastard form.''When you think of the development of Rock `n' Roll, Dylan going electric is the equivalent of what the industrial revolution is to the history of England. ''Just think what it must have been like to be a bright kid who loved rock music and then Dylan came along. What a fuckin' gift! It must have been so exciting.''I mean I like The Rolling Stones from around the same period when Dylan was `at his peak' but there's a 3-dimensional quality to him which the Stones don't have. You could look at a great album like \"Beggar's Banquet\" and know that the Stones would be bad in twenty years time. You could see that. Whereas when you look at something like \"Nashville Skyline\" you think there is probably hope that the new Dylan record could be really good -- in a way it's still surprising but in a way it isn't.''Dylan, like Mingus or Bill Wells, is a person who is motivated primarily just by his individual instinct. Dylan never followed.''Coming back to our theme, it's this preparedness to be fashionable or unfashionable, there's something really sad about the Stones, they always want to look hip and with the kids and that's why you get preposterous things like Jagger with 16 year old girls in their videos looking really turned on by them. It's really pretty unlikely, y'know? It's dishonest.''No matter how difficult you might find it to understand or empathise with Dylan's massive Christian conversion, the thing about Dylan which I love, is for one guy to have such belief in the face of everything and that's all the way through his career, from playing electric at Newport in the face of people like Pete Seeger who saw it as this massive betrayal, then to go on to be the biggest counter-cultural figure and walk out and give these OTT pro-Christian rants to his fans. And Bob's Christianity wasn't particularly enlightened or benign, it was total \"you will all burn in Hell\". Total belief again. Everyone is saying, \"Bob, what the fuck are you doing?\" But for him that was that. Incredible. In the face of everything, I respect that so much.''"

  "title": "The Late, Great Silver Jews - news segment about the new record",
  "body": "Staff Writer Chris Nelson reportsSilver Jews leader/poet David Berman understands that there's a risk in naming his upcoming album of pensive, literate, country-tinged rock The Late, Great Silver Jews. Still, he doesn't want fans to think that he's hanging up his guns just yet. In fact, he wouldn't have chosen the title if he didn't think that the Jews - including recently returned guitarist Steve Malkmus of lo-fi alt-rockers Pavement - still had a few more records up their sleeves. \"It's only good if it's, like, the third record of five,\" Berman said Thursday, phoning from Brooklyn, N.Y.'s Rare Book Room studio. There, he and his collaborators were wrapping up 22 straight days of rehearsal and recording for the album, the Jews' fourth. \"I guess there's a certain amount of 'Well, no one else is gonna to say it, so we're gonna say it,' \" Berman said of the album title. \"We're gonna canonize ourselves. We're not gonna wait around for anyone else to say we're great. It's a little funny, it's a little sad, it's a little arrogant.\" The album, due out this fall on Chicago's Drag City label, marks the homecoming of Malkmus to the Jews clan. Fans will recall that for 1996's The Natural Bridge album, songwriter Berman amicably parted company with collaborators Malkmus and drummer Bob Nastanovich, also of Pavement, in favor of working with the New Radiant Storm Kings' guitarist Matt Hunter and bassist Peyton Pinkerton. Now both Berman and Malkmus describe their reignited collaboration as a mutually beneficial venture between best friends. \"I wanted a really professional-sounding band, and Steve [Malkmus] is a really good guitarist,\" the 30-year-old Berman said. \"The leads he's playing on this record are to me the best things he's ever done, by far. Very soulful. He's not doing the anti-solos he does with Pavement. They're very beautiful, very talky.\" \"The songs are pretty traditional arrangements and tunings, and I'm just playing along with it,\" Malkmus said humbly on a break from the studio. \"Pavement songs call for something different. If you played a traditional solo in a Pavement song, it would stick out. But in these songs, there's totally room for it. It's fun to do it tasteful and straight-up, without sounding too much like new country.\" That said, Malkmus explained that three or four \"really heartbreaking country numbers\" form the backbone of the 11-song album. He and Berman have developed a symbiotic creativity, he added, whereby Malkmus brings musical and recording experience to Berman's songwriting expertise. \"It's a lyrical record in the end,\" the 30-year-old Malkmus said. \"It's a record you sing along to. In that way, it's kind-of country. You expect maybe the next melody, but you don't know what [Berman is] going to say. There's a cleverness to do that in a way that's not hacked or generic.\" During a brief pause in conversation, the delicate sound of ringing guitar from a song called \"Self-Ignition\" escaped through a studio door. Berman described the song as a future B-side, explaining that the band had run through the track too quickly for it to make the final cut for the album. \"We've never sounded tight like this,\" Berman said. \"There's hard-rocking songs where we've never had that level of intensity before. They're really charged songs.\" In addition to Malkmus, Berman also recruited Mike Fellows (ex-Rites of Spring, ex-Royal Trux bass), Tim Barnes (drums) and Chris Stroffolino (piano, keyboards) to help out with the disc, which he intends to issue on Oct. 14. That would be two years to the day after the release of The Natural Bridge, which came exactly two years after 1994's acclaimed Starlite Walker album. Berman added that he hopes the Silver Jews will set out for a rare tour of the U.S. and Europe following the release of the new recording. Work on the Silver Jews album has precluded Berman from editing his forthcoming collection of poetry - tentatively titled \"Governors On Sominex\" - which he hopes to have out on Open City Press by Christmas. Despite the fact that the book has languished on the back-burner, Berman has said that he's happy to push through the recording process. \"I never worked this hard in my fucking life,\" he said. \"It's really gratifying, because I'm such a lazy lay-about at home, just reading, lying around. So I've had something to do everyday. It's good. It's labor.\" Among the songs to be included on The Late, Great Silver Jews are: \"Buckingham Rabbit,\" \"Random Rules,\" \"Police Conversation, 1783,\" \"The Wild Kindness,\" \"Blue Arrangements,\" \"Like Like, The The The Death,\" \"People,\" \"Send In The Clouds,\" \"Smith And Jones Forever!\" and \"Honk If You're Lonely Tonight.\""

So I said to the guy \"Are you doing this because you like the record or because of the Pavement connection?\" He said because of the Pavement connection. Up until a few years ago only a handfull of people knew that the Silver Jews featured members of Pavement - what's changed? In the beginning I tried to hide the fact. I gave Steve a fake name and so forth but most people figured it out and it backfired. By keeping it a secret, people thought it was a bigger deal so we thought we'd stop telling secrets and tell the truth. If people then thought The Jew were a side project then fuck them. Bob and Steve treat it just as seriously as any other part of their lives. It's certainly not a career for me, it's like an extension of our friendship cos we've always played together. Technically, Pavement is a side project of the Silver Jews cos we were playing together well before Steve formed Pavement"

  "title": "Interview by Phone - from Opscene magazine",
  "body": "by Joep Vermaat, Opscene magazineSince a few months I've been working for a music Magazine in Holland called Opscene. It's not that big a magazine, only a few thousand copies get sold. It's completely independent and because of that also completely voluntary. But it's a great way to get my opinion across to more people than usual. Recently I had the honour to do an interview with David Berman of The Silver Jews. It was quite a nice experience, although it was only my second interview ever. The editor at Opscene didn't mind me spreading the interview around the net, because you won't ever buy the magazine anyway. It's a language thing. Named after Silva Joao, an ancient Brazillian hero. That was what the release info said about The Silver Jews' third record, Starlite Walker. But the boss of Drag City didn't hear the name right and made 'Silver Jews' out of it. \"I don't know what you're talking about\", David said, amused, when I asked him a question about the hero, \"but I think you're the victim of a bullshit story thought up by Drag City; they're notorious for that. No, we have had the name for a long time. And we just thought it up because we're fan of a lot of bands like The Silver Apples and The Silver Beatles. We wanted something with Silver in it, but Jewish. So, Silver Jews it became.\" The Silver Jews were founded around 1989 when David, Steve Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich still went to college together in Virginia. Far before Pavement had recorded anything. \"Most people think Silver Jews is a side project of Pavement. But it's really the other way around. Pavement only grew out to be a very popular side project.\" Because of their popularity, Silver Jews became more and more a solo vehicle for David. \"Still, we have lots of plans to do more things together in Silver Jews. Steve wants to make an album of his own, singing my songs. And there's gonna be a new EP on which I'm playing with other people for the first time, but still by the name of Silver Jews. And in January me and Will Oldham of Palace are going into the studio to record two very long songs by the name of Silver Palace. And we'll be touring early next year.\" Although this is a very busy schedule, David still sees making music as a hobby. \"I don't think Silver Jews will ever be very popular and that's all right. I do it because I like to. And if somebody else likes it, then that's fine.\" In daily life he's an English graduate; he writes fiction and poetry and he's working on getting his master's degree. To make some money he teaches at the University. For writing the songs he doesn't always use his writing skills. \"Early on, we just went into the studio, started a tape, smoked a joint and then started talking. Only 'The country diary of a Subway conductor' on the new record is made like that. But we used to record everything that way.\" For Starlite Walker David has taken his time to write songs. In the little city of Oxford, Mississippi, he rented a small cabin in the woods, just for inspiration. \"It was a very old laboratory of a retired chemist. It's in the middle of the woods about fifteen kilometers from Oxford. That's the place I lived and wrote the songs all summer long. And because Memphis is just an hour drive, we recorded them there.\" On the cover you can see why he chose this place to get inspired. \"That's a picture of a small house near the place I lived. But it looks like it. Mississippi is a wonderful place; it's very quiet. An area that has been forgotten for so long. If you're there, you get"

  "title": "Pitchfork Interview, January 2002",
  "body": "by Mark Richard-San for Pitchfork Media.Silver Jews started when David Berman began playing with Steve Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich in the late 80s at the University of Virginia. Early singles with Drag City were noisy and lo-fi, very much in step with the indie rock of the early 90s. With each new album, Berman simplified his approach and refined his writing technique, adopting a progressively countrified sound to complement his always witty and insightful lyrics. Sometimes Malkmus, Nastanovich or Steve West showed up for a record, and sometimes they didn't, but over time the erroneous assumption that Silver Jews were a \"Pavement side project\" faded.Meanwhile, Berman continued to pursue writing apart from music. The Baffler was wise enough to run his terrifically accomplished poetry regularly through the mid-90s, and he later placed his work with the highly regarded Open City. A book of poetry on Open City's publishing imprint made some waves in 1999, and he contributed an [http://www.gpalabs.com/ entertaining essay] about high school and ecstasy to Feed Magazine.Gore Vidal said of writer Italo Calvino, \"Reading [him], I had the unnerving sense that I was also writing what he had written; thus does his art prove his case as writer and reader become One.\" This is something like the sensation I get from listening to the Silver Jews. David Berman's writing, both with his music and in his poetry, has an uncanny ability to outline and map the blurry edges of consciousness. The following email interview took place in January.Pitchfork: Bright Flight strikes me as a bit closer to country than your other records. In \"Tennessee,\" the narrator fantasizes about moving to Nashville, writing sad songs and getting paid by the tear. I've noticed you have an affinity for a witty couplet that also says something sad, something Nashville songwriters have long been interested in. Do you feel a kinship with the country songwriting tradition? Any particular favorites among country songwriters? How about a favorite turn of phrase?Berman: Lyrically, country music is the most satisfying music for me. Even a cheap shot like Garth's \"Friends in Low Places\" is fascinating, like a hovering cube above my bed. It has a lot to do with concision and details that spread a fabric under the song. Bobby Braddock is great. Of course Bill Anderson. Roger Miller for weirdness. Some favorite titles: \"I'm Gonna Hire a Wino to Redecorate Our Home,\" a hit for David Frizzell in the early eighties, \"I Got in at 3 with a 10 and Woke Up at 10 with a 3\" is another. I just crack up when I hear the Bellamy Brothers' \"If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body (Would You Hold It Against Me).\" So damn gay it's hilarious.Pitchfork: Like most of us, the narrator of \"Friday Night Feeling\" loves the sound of a jukebox playing. What ten records would we find in your ultimate bar jukebox?Berman: Dinosaur Jr. - You're Living All Over MeRolling Stones - Beggars BanquetNew Order - Greatest HitsBob Wills - Last Time AroundRoyal Trux - Sweet SixteenThe Pogues - Rum Sodomy & The LashButthole Surfers - Hairway To StevenMercury Rev - See You On The Other SideCharlie Rich - Behind Closed DoorsJimmy Martin - You Don't Know My MindPitchfork: \"I Remember Me\" is one of my favorite songs on Bright Flight. It seems like a new kind of song for you, one with a very clear and direct narrative. Did you approach the writing of this song any differently? What role do you feel narrative plays in your writing in general?Berman: I always have wanted to sustain stories over the length of a song but haven't tried much because I figured it's someone else's turf. I mean, when you're writing songs you play to your strong side, and mine had always been fractured, however slightly, composition. I had been keeping off asking this woman I love to marry me for a handful of years. I knew I was going to eventually, but was happy to think of it always as 9 months off, when I had a little more money or something. For that song, I imagined I had the chance to ask taken away from me through the insertion of a runaway truck.Pitchfork: Do you have an interest in politics? Do you feel like political matters inform your songwriting?Berman: Probably insofar as I have a sometimes angry relationship with an abstract enemy called \"rich people\" that's been going on since I was a kid. It's a long story. It comes out in the songs. I think in \"We Are Real\" off the last album which is political in a pure sense, Us vs. The Forces That Lie To Us.Pitchfork: Silver Jews albums typically have one instrumental (my favorite is \"Night Society\"). What's the idea behind putting an instrumental on a record? Do you listen to much instrumental music yourself? What are some favorites?Berman: I always say they are put there as respite from the words and/or my voice (which doesn't agree with everyone to say the least) and I guess that's so. By now also it's just the way I order the records. They are all organized the exact same way, more or less. I'm a big fan of John Oswald's Grayfolded CD, which is 150 minutes of [the Grateful Dead's] Darkstar instrumental passages, hundreds of live versions laid on top of each other, twisted and manipulated.Pitchfork: Your writing is filled with place names, and it seems like you've moved around a fair amount. What are some of your favorite places for living and why?Berman: I don't think I've ever liked living in a city as much as I like Nashville now. The thing is you can't just pick a city, you have to pick a time too. NYC in 1989 was wildly different than NYC 1999. Austin was great in the 80s for me, but those same great qualities in a town draw people until \"it's just not the same anymore.\"Pitchfork: When do you think that first kid said, \"Punk's not dead, punk's not dead?\"Berman: Punk as it will be historically defined ended in the eighties. There were several last stands. The first Mudhoney single could have been the last. You can't talk about stuff like this without sounding like a total asshole.Pitchfork: How often do you pick up your guitar?Berman: I go months, sometimes years without. I usually get set to write a new record in my mind then go at it every day for a few hours until the album's done.Pitchfork: In Germany, the word for \"pizza\" is \"pizza\" and the word for \"hat\" is \"hut.\" Hence, some of the citizenry believes there's a chain called \"Pizza Hat,\" a belief reinforced by the fact that the \"red roof\" logo for this pizza chain looks like a bright red cap. When I heard this, it seemed like something that could be a Silver Jews lyric. Do you ever work something you overhear into your writing? How much of your imagery is inspired by things you actually see?Berman: I get a lot of ideas from mistakes like that. Sometimes I turn the TV just below where you can hear it and write down what I think they might be saying by the mumbles and rhythms. I think Derrida proposed that the reason Hegel is so revered in Western philosophy must in some small part be related to the fact that his last name sounds like \"eagle\" in so many Western languages.Pitchfork: Another question about imagery: Did you actually see BB King on \"General Hospital?\"Berman: I came into the living room and a soap opera's credits were rolling. I could have sworn I saw his name roll by. It seemed so unlikely, so incongruous that it captured my imagination. I saw him as a heart attack patient or an entertainer at a nurse's birthday party. Whatever happened on the real show, it was then my intellectually property, \"I saw BB King on General Hospital,\" and I can say that with conviction.Pitchfork: Certain words and phrases appear and reappear in your work. For example, the term \"split-level ranch\" appears in at least two songs and one poem. What comes to mind for you with that specific image?Berman: Those houses with floors that were really only half floors. Half a staircase that you could leap from kitchen to den and land on your knees cause the carpet was so thick. It's just one of those phrases that hold a lot inside of them.Pitchfork: I'm consistently impressed by the haiku-like compression in your lyrics and poetry. I have this theory that a complex experience can be packed into just a few carefully chosen words and slipped under the door to the reader, who can then unpack the phrase and get the full experience of the writer on the other side. For example, the line, \"An anchor lets you see the river move,\" from \"How to Rent a Room.\" I've spent hours thinking about all the implications of that line, many of which I imagine occurred to you when you wrote it. What technique is involved in achieving such compression?Berman: First you have to write a lot of sentences. Then you've got to switch to the other side and become the reader. Be hard on yourself. Take out those things that don't advance the cause even if you're fond of them. Then again and again. Allen Ginsburg was wrong about a lot of things, but especially when he said, \"First thought, best thought.\"Pitchfork: A few years ago, you said you wanted to wait to publish your poetry until it could get sufficient distribution. You said you didn't want to publish in the literary equivalent of a Drag City, because you were afraid of your poetry being lost in the shuffle. Were you satisfied with the impact that Actual Air had? Where are you publishing your writing now?Berman: The book got around. The Open City people are well connected to say the least. I mean, a review of a small press book of poetry in GQ? They did a good job. Lately, I'm not publishing anything right now. I'm waiting for a new Me to show up in my mind.Pitchfork: When you worked as a security guard at the Whitney, did you ever have to wrestle anybody to the ground? What were your duties?Berman: We had walkie-talkies. But the head guard would get mad if you fooled around with them. You called code two if you had to go to the bathroom. Malkmus and I would call code twos at the same time and go get high in Central Park. There were millions of hijinx. The other guards were genuinely fascinating, each and every one. I think guarding knocks a screw lose eventually. All that thinking time.Pitchfork: Do you make a living from your writing and music? What's the worst job you ever had? What was so bad about it?Berman: The best way to describe it is, \"I get by.\" I probably make $23,000 a year. For a 35-year old that's not so hot, but my goal when I left college was not to have a boss. And I've met it for going on 7 years. Now it looks like those days may be over. But its always looked that way and then in the last minute a check from nowheresville moved the sentencing date forward. Like a $5,000 check from The Minus Times for my essay \"Why I Hate Movies.\" My worst job was working as an orderly in a hospital in Virginia that took in all the 800-lb. people from the mountains who had to be cut out of their log cabins. Took three men to turn them on their side so the nurses could change the sheets. I was heaving the ass up when this feller shit liquid green turds all over my hands and forearms. Smoking angel dust in the morgue was cool, though.Pitchfork: What's next for David Berman and the Silver Jews?Berman: I actually have no fucking idea."

  "body": "Interview with David Berman of the Silver Jews\\Conducted by M.Edwards in 1996 for a zine called Chapter 57In the Fall of 1996 I was employed as a seafood clerk at a supermarket, I was also listening to the Natural Bridge quite a bit. I had the idea to interview David for a zine I was planning on putting out back then. I wrote out a group of questions while standing behind the seafood counter (the smell of week old perch in my nostrils and lack of sleep may have had something to do with some of these questions) and sent them off. Not long after I was surprised to see a letter from David; he had replied to every question and sent a photo to boot! It always bothered me that the zine never saw the light of day and David's generosity went unrewarded. I hope to mend the situation by publishing it here for the first time in honor of the release of Tanglewood Numbers. - M. EdwardsME: Is that your car pictured on the back of The Natural Bridge insert?DCB: That photo is of the interior of a 1979 Subaru station wagon that I owned for one summer in the early nineties. it had a tiny engine that would top out at about 25 m.p.h.. That was great in school zones but I kept getting pulled over by cops for going too slow.ME: How is it in Charlottesville right now?DCB: Charlottesville is a good place to live right now. It was a up and down year if you're a Cavaliers football fan. I was lucky enough to attend the North Carolina and Texas games with their accompanying post-game celebrations and on the other hand nearly hospitalized for depression after losses to Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech, and Clemson. Once Charlottesville was ruled by the legacy of Thomas Jefferson. Recently Dave Matthews knocked TJ off the throne. We worship his jams now.ME: Is the Silver Jews your job now, or are you employed somewhere else? Do you have any memorable first jobs? I once worked 10 hour nights painting a restaurant by myself, I think I ate my weight in club sandwiches.DCB: I've been unemployed for about two years. Somewhere a rumor started that I was teaching at a university. That would be nice if it were true. I wouldn't mind at all. From 12-15 I groomed horses. At 15 I got my break in the dishwashing field, that lasted until I heard Hollywood calling and was hired to tear tickets at a Loew's theater. In college I got hired by the hospital to take the dead to the morgue and put them in the fridge. That lasted 3 years before I went back to dishwashing. In New York I was a security guard at the Whitney Museum of American Art for three years. I have no skills. I am currently unemployed.ME: Speaking of work, I was reading the lyrics to The Natural Bridge on the clock yesterday, when a woman I work with snatched it and began reading it, after about thirty seconds she said, \"Gosh, they sure do use the word Cum a lot don't they?\".DCB: Cum shows up three times on the record. When I was a kid people always used to say \"cumbucket\". It made a picture in my mind, cum slopped over the edges. I forgot about the word for years until forming this album it came up again and kept sneaking into songs. Cum is a very private issue. The Natural Bridge has a lot of privacy issues going on inside.ME: How do you write the lyrics that fill Silver Jews records? Is there a process or is it just a moment by moment kind of thing?DCB: First I write some simple music. Play it for a couple days until it begins to make its own lyrical demands. Try to fill the order as best you can. Mood is the touchstone. It's definitely not spontaneous.ME: In the song \"Frontier Index\" you use the term \"Sub-space\", what is the sub- space? is that like your separated perception of this reality? Everyone having a sub-space to move in the over-space.DCB: What is sub-space? I don't know. It just sounds cool. No, just kidding. Well I'm only half-kidding. The other half is this: I might use a concept like sub-space because I know it has meaning, I even know what it is, you even know what it is or you wouldn't have brought it up, but we probably won't have much luck talking about it. There is a level at which I can refer, I can even understand but I am not articulate enough to explain. Religion is nice that way, it only requires an ability to do the first two things.ME: \"Ballad\" is another interesting song on The Natural Bridge. Who is the \"extra in our midst\"?DCB: \"The extra in our midst\" is supposed to be the devil, from the perspective of the reverend the devil has brought these different characters to their individual miseries. This is not the way I see the world. It's funny though, I found out after I wrote the song, by reading the \"Origin of Satan\" by Elaine Pagels that in ancient Israel census taking was against Jewish law. King David tried to have one taken in 1000 B.C. for the purposes of taxation. The people were very upset and tried to revolt. In the old testament (I Chronicles 21:1) it is explained that Satan tempted David into instituting the census.ME: Do you have a favorite type of pants? A lot of stores in my area quit carrying Levi 517's, which has forced me too country/western department stores in London, Ky.DCB: I like dark blue Duckheads, plain fronts, size 36 waist, 32 length.ME: What was your favorite class through out your collegiate career?DCB: My favorite class was Forest Fire Management in the Forestry Dept.ME: If you were stranded on an island and you happened to bring a book with you, what do you hope that book would be?DCB: I don't know it would have to be something that you could go back to time and time again which for me would discount a novel. I guess I would bring somebody's collected poems. Probably Wallace Stevens'.ME: Have you ever visited Louisville? What were your impressions of this town?DCB: Yes I've been to Louisville two times for 24 hours a piece. I liked it very much one of those times. Western Ky struck me as being like a mixture of Indiana and Tennessee. I think Brown and Williamson makes shitty cigarettes and I have zero interest in racing, but any town that is responsible for Brett Ralph and Fading Out is A-OK with me.ME: Was the lyrics to \"Rebel Jew\" a first person narrative of your own true heart, or were you writing from another perspective?DCB: In \"Rebel Jew\" only the third verse/chorus is strictly from my perspective. The first two are those strange mixtures: a little of who you are, a little of who you might have been if things had gone differently, and a little of who you'd like to be.ME: Did your parents ever attend any cool concerts, back in the day? My mom claims to have seen The Beatles in Cincinnati, when she was 14. I heard you were conceived at Woodstock.DCB: My stepmother saw Jimi Hendrix and the Doors in Dallas. My Dad met Gerald Ford.ME: So what's the skinny, do you like Pearl Jam or not?DCB: No I don't like Pearl Jam. I tried. Alice in Chains is much better. Nirvana was boring. Soundgarden has a lot of great songs. Their greatest hits record will kick ass.ME: Do you have any collaborations planned?DCB: No I don't have any collaborations planned outside of sex with my girlfriend. Wait this is a family magazine. Apparently all the gold ever mined would fit into a cube 3 x 20 yards."

  "title": "A Limited Edition Of One",
  "body": "In Conversation, sort of, with David Berman by Justin Taylor\\Originally published in The Brooklyn RailCritical validation and cultural cachet, as it turns out, don’t pay all that well. Touring to promote his records might have, but for David Berman, an intensely private individual, tours (and advertising) have always been out of the question. Berman releases his art into the world to succeed or fail on its own merits - an almost unthinkable position for an artist to take in today’s media-saturated culture with its demands for presence. But the contrarianism is authentic, just a part of the Berman package, which he’ll be first to point out you can take or leave.This autumn, the release of Tanglewood Numbers will break the Silver Jews’ long silence since 2001’s Bright Flight. Berman, the band’s lyricist and lead singer, is also the author of a phenomenal book of poems, Actual Air (Open City, 1999).What follows was compiled from a series of email exchanges. Terse and enigmatic, occasionally ignoring questions outright, Berman was nearly impossible to pin down, which was especially frustrating since everyone wants to believe that their musical or literary heroes could easily be their drinking buddies or best friends. But Berman is a man who can say a lot even when he’s not saying much, and his general reticence served to increase the gravity of moments when he actually opened up. Just another part of the Berman package, I suppose.Rail: Sonically, the new record stands somewhat apart from the rest of the Silver Jews catalog. How did the Tanglewood Numbers band come together?DB: I don’t have a million friends who make music. The ten or so that do I got to come down here. I got a friend to engineer it. A friend to film some. Everybody from top to bottom I had a personal relationship with.Rail: Of the players, I’d think Stephen Malkmus and Will Oldham are the most readily identifiable. I placed Malkmus pretty easily but I couldn’t find Oldham.DB: He’s playing rhythm guitar on about half the songs. People think, ‘Why would you get a singer to play guitar?’ That kind of thinking isn’t very imaginative. Will’s guitar-playing has a correlative in my own life in the form of his friendship. Like Paz’s banjo-playing expresses something of what I love about Paz and people with Paz’s qualities. That should give the music some biographical strata, and a sympathetic band to boot, don’t you think?Rail: Yeah, that makes sense. I knew you were acquainted with Oldham but I didn’t realize you were very close. A lot of what’s written about you just ties you back to Malkmus, maybe at the expense of other friends/collaborators in your life? Well screw that, if it’s the case; how did you meet Oldham?DB: Will and I have been friends since a summer in ‘95 when he came to the town I lived in (Charlottesville) and rented a house and we set out to make a Silver Palace record. Nothing got recorded that summer but we’ve been close ever since. I’m not very close with Malkmus anymore. He’s kind of far away. Will is just up the road and always down to visit.Rail: Nashville’s an interesting place. My parents recently relocated to there from South Florida. Why did you move there?DB: People are funny and optimistic. I love living in a city where music is common currency, where no one second-guesses giving your whole life and all your energy towards the making of it. Bankers, barbers, they all understand that songwriting is a noble pursuit.Rail: Does your approach vary if you’re writing a poem rather than song, or vice-versa?DB: Believe me, Justin, and I’m not being rude, but this line of inquiry has never led me or anyone else anywhere interesting.Rail: Okay, well, what are you reading these days? I noticed Denis Johnson’s collected poems in a photo posted to The Corduroy Suit, which I’m assuming is a photo of your bookcase.DB: I’m reading Epictetus: Enchiridion. Some good poets I’ve read lately: Joe Wenderoth, Michael Palmer, Michael Burkard (Denis Johnson loves this guy), Matthea Harvey. I’m trying to make time for a major rereading of Yeats and Eliot.Rail: I read this old interview where you were talking about reading Raymond Carver and Tobias Wolff as a sort of preparation for adulthood. Do you still read with that sort of mindset - of reading to prepare? And does it work?DB: It’s worked in the sense that reading over a lifetime has consistently widened my sympathy for other human beings, particularly other people in trouble. Following the failures (in terms of the characters’ lives) of Oedipus and Madame Bovary should make you kinder and more aware of the way chance maims our best plans.Rail: Like with touring? I mean, it’s clear that you don’t really want to tour, but I’ve been hearing that you might do it for this record. Do you ever look at it and say, \"Well, X would make the whole thing a lot more palatable.\"DB: Opportunities for isolation and space. So maybe a Ryder truck with a living room set up inside it.Rail: Do you ever think about taking a turn as a college professor or writer-in- residence at a university?DB: I don’t know. Not if I can avoid it. I should stay away from the rock clubs and the English departments if I can.Rail: Any particular reason? I mean, academia has its drawbacks, obvious and otherwise, but you must have some faith in that system since you got an MFA…Or was it getting the MFA that cured you of that faith?DB: At that time in my life, getting an MFA and teaching bought me three years in which to become a better writer. Somewhere in those three years I started writing songs. I just mean for the sake of any art form it’s healthy for some to stay away from \"central command.\"Rail: I suppose Nashville offers that distance. I’ve heard you talk about becoming involved with the Jewish community there. Were you raised Jewish?DB: No.Rail: Are you of Jewish lineage, or \"culturally Jewish\" as it tends to get phrased by modern American secular Jews (like myself, for example)?DB: I was raised outside organized religion and only in recent years have I been able to sustain faith in God for more than ten minutes at a time. The continuance of this relationship through reading the Torah, prayer, etc., I think will be the main thing I work on for the rest of my life.Rail: There’s always been a theological strain in your music and writing, though it doesn’t get talked about much. Not like, say, your Civil War imagery, which people seem to get hung up on. Does it ever feel like reviewers don’t really know what to do with that?DB: I don’t know. I tell people that the Civil War is too commercial for me now. I’m only into obscure little wars you’ve never heard of.Rail: Try me.DB: I was just making a joke about record collectors. In the eighties everyone bought limited-edition seven-inches. The smaller the edition, the better. That seems ludicrous now, when everyone wants to be as \"large\" as possible. There was a time when obscurity was cherished. So maybe this is a generation thing.Rail: Maybe. Incidentally, my sister is about to start her last year of high school. Do you have any advice for her?DB: It’s a thought from Schopenhauer: \"In this world there is only a choice between loneliness and vulgarity.\"Rail: That’s a hell of a choice. Have you made yours?DB: Well it’s been loneliness up till now but it looks like things are changing for the better/worse.Rail: I tried to frame this next question a lot of different ways, including, \"What’s up with all the water?\" and, \"What does water mean to you?\" I finally came up with, \"Could you talk about how you use water as an image or symbol?\" which sounds more intelligent, but maybe isn’t.DB: Well, you know no one’s ever asked that before, seriously. It seems obvious now that you bring it up. I was mowing the lawn and it was 96 degrees yesterday and I poured a bottle of cold water over my head and I felt like a commercial even though nobody was looking.Rail: Are you working on another book of poems?DB: Not intensely.Rail: What about the reissuing of early Silver Jews material? Is that being worked on?DB: It will be released in October of 2006. A year after Tanglewood Numbers.Rail: So are you a musician who also writes, or are you a writer with a band?DB: Neither. I’m a limited edition of one.Justin Taylor is a freelance writer based in New York City. See his collected works online at http://www.justindtaylor.net, if you’re into that sort of thing. "

  "title": "A Surprise In Itself",
  "body": "From: [http://www.3ammagazine.com 3:AM Magazine]About a dozen years ago, I interviewed Guided by Voices' Bob Pollard and Tobin Sprout in a grotty room above the now defunct Duchess in Leeds  -  and it was one of the most gruelling interviews of my life. I'd had such high hopes. I remember walking through the doors of the Duchess as the band were sound checking  -  and they were sound checking with a song called 'Your Name is Wild' which I thought was particularly auspicious (given my surname). The band didn't see the joke. The band were, in fact, the proverbial blood from a stone. I could just tell that they thought I was a total idiot. They didn't want to be interviewed, particularly by me. It was one of those experiences that haunts you. And it rose, like a grisly spectre, as I made my way to interview Silver Jews' frontman David Berman. Because. Well. I read that David Berman didn't like giving interviews. I read that David Berman had suffered some ups and downs in recent years (going as far as trying to take his life a few years back). I thought ''oh no oh no oh no: it's going to be another Guided by Voices.''Which just goes to show that you shouldn't believe everything you read.David Berman is not difficult. He is softly spoken. Bearded. Given to long pauses. He is 39. Stick insect thin. His eyes are a little dark, but this is the only real evidence of any ghosts. His band Silver Jews formed way back in 1992 and has over the years involved collaborations with the likes of Steve Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich (at one time, the band were unfairly regarded as something of a Pavement spin-off), Will Oldham, Azita Youssefi and various members of Lambchop, Royal Trux and Jesus Lizard. As far as what they sound like: like The Fall, they are always different and always the same. They emerged out from under the aegis of 80s punk and ploughed a distinctive country rock furrow  -  but they didn't tour. In point of fact, I catch up with David Berman, erstwhile Silver Jews frontman, 12 years into his career and out on the road for the very first time.I kick off by asking him why it's taken so damn long to tour. ''A lot of different things happened at once'', David said. ''For a long time, we didn't have to tour. In the beginning, because of the Pavement thing, we were able to sell a certain amount of records. We were able to sell not such a great amount of records, but enough to live on. So there was no incentive to do what didn't come naturally. Obviously there was the idea that we could sell more records if we played live, but I guess I didn't care enough to sell more records to do that.'' In the past, David has gone on record as saying that, from time to time, it sort of teed him off that people kept referring to Silver Jews as a Pavement spin-off. So I ask him whether he was waiting for Pavement's split to die down before embarking on the tour. He laughs. ''I was waiting for all of the bands that existed when we started to break up. There are very few bands from 1992 still around. Saying all of that, you're the first person to mention Pavement. In 35 shows, I've been waiting for someone to shout 'Box Elder' or something but so far so good.'' After 35 shows, I say, he must be getting to be a dab hand at the whole live thing. ''In the beginning, people told me that they were both excited and worried,'' David said, quietly. ''They were worried that what they would see would be''  -  he pauses and looks around the basement room in which we find ourselves  -  ''something uncomfortable. It's been a struggle to remember some of the words. Two nights ago, I spaced out in the middle of 'Pet Politics' and I forgot the words  -  but I looked out and the audience helped me. They could see that I didn't know. But it wasn't uncomfortable. There's a lot of love and affection.'' David paused again at this point. You can see him drawing a bead on a thought. ''I'm glad I'm not a young person,'' he said. '''(The reaction) is really gratifying, but it doesn't change the way that I see myself. In 2004, I don't think any Silver Jews fan was probably expecting another record.'' Certainly not a record as upbeat and rocking as ''Tanglewood Numbers'', (the most recent Silver Jews album] I interrupted. David nodded and said, ''The fact that I'm doing this is a surprise in itself.''I ask him if there have been any other surprises on the tour. He says, ''The last few shows we played in Israel were pretty much the most amazing experience of my life. This woman gave me a book of Hassidic tales. Her brother, she told me, had been the number one Silver Jews fan in Israel and  -  this is not a tragedy, but  -  he found religion and (these days) he studies Torah and he finds it completely unreal that Silver Jews are coming to Israel. She said he wanted to thank me for naming the band Silver Jews. And...'' David paused again at this point, paused to the degree that  -  given his earlier comment about 'Pet Politics' made me wonder whether he was spacing out. ''That knocked me out. That there was some Hassidic man sitting at home in his living room reading the Torah who wouldn't couldn't go to the Silver Jews show... but, as a kid, he would've been in some ways shaped by it... You can see that this had a huge effect on David. A lot of the Jews I met in Israel, almost all of them are secular. They get turned off by their religion, in the same way that Americans get turned off Christianity by people like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robinson. So... to me, maybe to some of them... someone like me, from America, comes in and sings these dubious theological stories and stuff like that and makes it okay to look into it... I don't know.''At this point, I kind of felt like we were teetering on some theological brink and so I tried to reel things in somewhat; I ask, given that it's fairly momentous, Silver Jews touring, whether there are any plans to follow in the footsteps of his buddy Will Oldham, and release a live album (Will released an album called ''Summer in the Southeast'', under his Bonnie Prince Billy moniker last year). ''Yeah,'' David said, sort of excitedly. ''The two Israel shows we did were filmed. I'm getting the band Hot Chip to remix the song 'Punks in the Beerlight''' (the first track on ''Tanglewood Numbers'')'','' ''and that is going to be released with a Live in Israel DVD.''By now, the ghost of Guided by Voices had long departed and we were having a good old chinwag. In addition to fronting Silver Jews, David Berman is also a published poet. His book, ''Actual Air'', is well worth picking up if you're a Jews fan or, hell, even a poetry fan. So we got talking about writing. ''You see, I'd been watching an old Paul Newman movie, ''Cool Hand Luke'', before I left the house to interview David  -  and there's a bit in'' Cool Hand Luke ''where Paul Newman gets a telegram informing him that his mother has died and Paul's reaction is to walk the length of the room, pick up a banjo and start to sing. I couldn't decide whether singing was catharsis or distraction.'' Given David's well-publicised ups and downs, I wondered how he saw the whole writing and performing thing. ''Not writing,'' he said. ''Performing I do.'' Reading between the lines I figure that he means performing is both catharsis and distraction. ''While I'm singing, I'm rereading the songs through the faces and wondering how I would view them if I was hearing them for the first time. But writing... Writing is pretty much always... It's a pleasure when you have your Eurekas but it's a problematic activity to say the least. I did stop writing. (The urge) was medicated down. I made myself so I didn't care.''I said to David that I wondered how songs and poems suggested themselves. I guess that I imagined a huge internal mail chute, with parcels labelled either SONG or POEM, falling into his lap. ''It's not a mail chute, it's more  -  he lifts his hands up, makes a sort of antler shape alongside his head  -  it's more outgoing... Sometimes I'll have something and I'll wonder if it's a poem or a song. But I haven't really been writing any poetry. Maybe I've grown out of it. ''Maybe you'll come back to it in your 60s? I say.'' That would be nice,'' he says and smiles  -  David Berman has a great smile, his whole face lights up. ''It could be my fly-fishing.''Cass, David's wife, recently joined the band and is now part of the touring group. She comes over as we're talking and feeds David a dumpling. I ask David if it's good having the missus out with him on the road. ''It's great,'' he says, smiling again. ''It's great for me. I get to bring my home with me. And it's great for her. Gets her out of the shitty office job for a while. It remains to be seen if it's good for a marriage.'' David laughs a hearty laugh. ''Cassie and I have gone through so many things... So many hard things... There was always... ''I watch him cast about for the right words. ''One thing that was never hard was her and I. It's always been easy.''We talk songs some more. I asked him if his favourite songs, the songs that came to mind as his best songs if he was asked, had changed now that he was performing them live for the first time. He said yeah. ''I know which ones are over achievers and which ones are live underachievers. I'd say like for instance 'Random Rules' is a better song on record, 'Smith & Jones' is way better live.'' I say, 'Random Rules' was the first Silver Jews song I ever heard. He smiled some more. ''It's always fun to do. It's one of those ones where you sing the first words and everyone goes Ahhhhhhh... All these things are still new to me. I'm learning. I like that...''Cass is looking over by this point and I know that I should leave the man alone and let him have some feed before they go on, but I have to ask whether it will be another three years until the next record. ''The band is touring throughout the summer. I think of September though December as the time when I'm going to try and do a record. I don't write the songs as I go along.'' So, I say, you don't write songs on the road, as of yet, and try them out live? ''I don't think I'll be that kind of performer,'' he says. ''I think I would want everything to exist as a recording first...'' He looks off again and I wonder if he's spacing out, but he's just thinking.''Unless the song was just, you know... too good. He shakes his head, smiling. That would be a nice problem to have...''== ABOUT THE INTERVIEWER =='''Peter Wild''' is the co-founder of [http://www.bookmunch.co.uk Book Munch].

  "title": "Berman Untangles New Silver Jews Album",
  "body": "Breaking the longest musical silence of his decade-plus career, David Berman has reactivated his Silver Jews project for its fifth studio album, \"Tanglewood Numbers.\" Due Oct. 18 via Drag City, the 10-track set boasts the return of longtime collaborators/former Pavement members Stephen Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich, who took a breather from the Jews' 2001 album, \"Bright Flight.\"\"For the first time, I really am happy with the record in the sense that I will listen to it without it being a painful experience,\" Berman tells Billboard.com from his Nashville hometown. \"In my mind, this is a hard rock record. The last one was more of a vocal record. With my limited voice, my reaction to displaying it is that it's necessary to put it right out front and not to hide it. But on this record, it's a rock record, so I thought the voice would become more of an instrument.\"\"Tanglewood Blues\" will hardly earn comparisons to Black Sabbath or Ozzy Osbourne (of whom Berman confesses a recent obsession, along with Johnny Paycheck), it does feature a handful of more propulsive tracks than usual, including opener \"Punks in the Beerlight\" and the frothy, lyrically beguiling \"Sometimes a Pony Gets Depressed.\"What it mostly offers up is another helping of literate, country-tinged rockers (\"Animal Shapes,\" \"K-Hole\") and maudlin ballads (\"The Farmer's Hotel,\" the first three minutes of \"There Is a Place\"). A major new contributor is Berman's wife Cassie, who offers effective vocal counterpoint on a number of cuts and inspired the artist to fill \"20 of those little yellow legal pads\" with ideas.Malkmus plays guitar on every song, while other contributions were turned in by Drag City labelmate Will Oldham, former A Perfect Circle/Papa M member Paz Lenchantin, former Jesus Lizard guitarist Duane Denison and keyboardist Tony Crow.But \"Tanglewood Blues\" nearly got the better of Berman, who wrestled control of the project from engineer Mark Nevers just as it was ready to be mixed, following a dispute over its musical direction. At one point, Berman says Nevers even threatened to throw the master tapes into the Cumberland River. Cooler heads eventually prevailed (Nevers and Berman remained friends), and the mix was completed by Joe Funderburk, a Nashville veteran of albums by the Judds and Glen Campbell.\"He's just a really, really peculiar fellow,\" Berman says of Funderburk. \"His house has goat skulls on the walls. I was really frightened to go there and do things. I didn't know Joe and I didn't want to hang out in a haunted house all day. But it turned out great.\"In fact, Berman is so pleased with the finished product that the notoriously stage-shy artist seems more likely than ever to support it with live shows at some point in 2006. Estimating that he's performed \"about 12\" times in his career, Berman acknowledges, \"My attitude about performance is more mercenary now.\"Before, it was something I really felt couldn't be successful and shouldn't be done,\" he continues. \"I wasn't in the business of peddling music and going out and selling myself. I want to go make a record and then return to my own life. But it has gotten the point where I can't afford to just make money off records. I'm so far in debt from hospital bills over the last few years and just not working, that I can't afford to be so protective of my art anymore. I refused to be an entertainer, but I guess I'm open to the idea of seeing if I can be an entertainer.\"But Berman points out that touring could also offer the added benefit of extra time spent with his wife. \"I was thinking, why not have Cassie's voice be the second voice instead of Malkmus' voice? I can't be sure that if I ever want to play live that Malkmus can even be there, but I know Cassie can,\" he says. \"If I want to play some shows in 2006, bringing my wife is like the best idea in the world.\"Also on the horizon for Berman: the follow-up to his 1999 novel \"Actual Air\" (\"I need a six-month stretch where I say, 'just this' [before beginning work on it],\" he offers) and a collection of early, previously unreleased Silver Jews material.\"I have hundreds of tapes of me, Bob and [Malkmus], but I've been real reluctant to go through them,\" he admits. \"Each one is 45 minutes long and we would just kind of let the thing run and make up songs for that night. It's like the Library of Congress.\""

  "title": "Window Swimming with David Berman and the Titans",
  "body": "A Silver Jews dissertation by Domenic MaltempiI am a 'fan' of the music and the over-all art of David's for a long time, the music came to me. IM sure more than a few readers are in the same submarine, enough said then. No 'all the news that's fit to print,' quasi-objectivity or something here.I like the way cooking outdoors smells more in October. That's when the idea to ask David for an interview hit me. Since then DB has been in the thick of fantasy league football, doing readings of his poetry, and staying very busy in total. This also happens to be the first interview with DB since his recent marriage, which happily occurred this past November.October wafts in reminders of some very special things and it sticks in your craw. For a dedicated few, one such aroma is certainly the music of the Silver Jews, and the man who has been behind it and in front of it, David Berman of Nashville, Tennessee.Pumpkins commit suicide in late November if left on the porches too long. Anyone can tell you that, but not quite like David Berman. This writing will omit the perfunctory talk of Berman being a, \"confidante of indie-rock royalty, a Nashville rebel, a man too eccentric for touring life,\" and so forth. We all know this image grafting to be rubbish even if meant to be flattering.Obviously these are silly caricatures as an overall presentation or in general, when thinking about a man serious enough to punch the world in its black hole with a comic ambling through many painted over landscapes.The 'Halloween' season has always had a special place in the Silver Jew fan's heart. I presume that Berman's strong emphasis, or attention on the elements in his songs and poetry: the air, water, if not the low brown-green of the super terrestrial, is best understood when heard in the fall season.It's as if autumn gets the minds talking car to park where it wants. One feels the Kit and Kat. New presses roll out new senses to re-experience the elemental because there is more variation and palpable traces of these elements in combination. Of course it is a different story if you don't really get an autumn where you live. But autumn is more than just a season, just as wars are more than a way to sell Operation 'kick ass' sets at J.C Penny's for kids, or even more than comics bombing at Hawaiian U.S.O. shows.As Silver Jews fans from thin figured Austrian villages to the accidental Ohio towns known to only a few, the fall season is a time to anticipate something from the Silver Jews' David Berman.This is the season the Silver Jews five full length releases have been offered up to those music fans craving more than trick or treats, teen witch-batons, donkey hybrid masks, eggs, shaving gel, and the hankering to embarrass the bleacher sluts and bonfire toughs in the perfumed hiding spots.There is one exception to the release pattern, which is the first Silver Jews full-length album The Arizona Record. There has never been an investigation into this anomaly. There will probably never be one upon thinking out the newest haircuts in charge.All of these records are out and can be sought, or bought at www.dragcity.com, with the exception of The Arizona Record (out of print, but you might find it in select yard sales if your feeling more accidental than the next woman or man).The following is a list of release dates in no particular order. They may also serve as substitute holidays, as they do for me in my own marimba in the black course kind of way.:Natural Bridge October 1, 1996:American Water October 20, 1998:Starlite Walker October 24, 1994:Bright Flight November 20, 2001:The Arizona Record July 7, 1993Bust out the astral charts buddy.I was going to get mystical with the dates for fun, but thought better against it. Instead, I asked David a question related to it...:Q: I am somewhat familiar with your preference for the October, mid-fall release date. One of the early images your songs helped craft in my mind is that of valium-addled kids in some suburb of Vicksburg, never making it to any house during Halloween, but having a grand old time... Are there any particular lines of resonance that you can trace to this distinct time period which have inspired these chosen release dates? The only deviation is The Arizona Record, and it makes perfect sense to me in that it is seven days before Bastille Day.:DB: You could say I'm a Capricorn, i always feel like its autumn in world history, i have deep eeyore tendencies. but don't get me wrong, i have fun on sundays in football season. I've got tix for the colts/titans game Tomorrow. if we win we take the division with three games left. nast comes down from louisville and we go downtown to the stadium. when we win there is a great feeling of joy and uplift to be shared among 67,000 people.:I'm generally known as a hibernator, especially when winter's coming on. Maybe my body emits the records as a temporary farewell. i STILL GO OUT TO BARS TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK BUT MY COMMUNICATIONS WITH PEOPLE BECOME ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY LOCAL IN THE WINTER. I don't make as many phone calls, hardly ever travel, and as you yourself Domenic have seen, have difficulty even returning emails. I have a feeling that these Billy the Kid quotes should also be in this piece, because they have been looking for a home since year 2000 when I stumbled on them in my friend's library kitchen, and they have a peculiar germaneness. Call the interview cops if you want.* ''At least two-hundred men have been killed in Lincoln County during the past three years, but I did not kill all of them.''---Billy the Kid to a reporter for the Daily New Mexican newspaper after his capture at Stinking Springs.* \"Hello Bob!''---Billy the Kid to Deputy Bob Olinger seconds before he killed him with his own shotgun, April 28, 1881.* \"There's many a slip 'twix the cup and the lip.''---Billy the Kid. (OR WAS THIS BERMAN over a hundred plus years ago, Italics me)* ''He never seemed to care much for money, except to buy cartridges with; then he would much prefer to gamble for them straight. Cartridges were scarce, and he always used about ten times as many as any one else.''---Frank Coe, referring to Billy the Kid. Yes, if only Billy made music instead of people dead. I mean, what does a shotgun look at, all pretty in some collapsing fortress? These are the turning questions that Berman has etched in my mind. This is something like the overall effect of this art in a microcosmic kind of way. I'm not sure...Without blinking, and certainly dancing slowly, David strives for a truth. This might seem to some something quixotically lofty, so much so as to be capsized before embarking on the expedition, but not as I understand David's way.In the insert territory of a Scud Mountain Boy CD (Pine Box), Berman writes early on that: \"I'm renewing my vow to bear down on the truth even if there is none for the hundredth time.\" I'll be flogged if this sentiment isn't something like the quintessence of the movement of David's art, from the music of the Silver Jews to his various prose and poetic works. It just walks like that.The approach in Berman's music is kind of like some Pre-Socratic 'way'. A world before unspecialized individuals got really disconnected from thinking upon this or that without being so far removed from the elemental, from their world. A world where poetry and 'science' were not Platonically broken up as some anti-thetical pair. A time when there was this poetic space flow, a thick braid to pull on when plumbing for ways to understand the inextricable nature of all phenomenon, wasn't yanked out of the skull of possibility. Listening to these songs, the voice, the unity of it, one does not feel like such a buckled in passenger, but the one holding the back road maps, and working the A/C.For over ten years, Silver Jews have coupled David Berman's lyrics of thought-provoking observation and powerful 'incidental' acumen with an assortment of players that have helped bring all of the reconnaissance into fruition.The music is as deliberate and without ostentation as the lyrics, whether ballads or hard-toned songs, even a genre that I think peculiarly Jewish and Silver, which I call, 'get you're ass in here.' There is an obvious comic sweep through all of it, somehow this hilarity feels like walking beside the thing, the thing is the movement of the song, the trickle, flood, machine songs over water, the robots cry in David's songs, I repeat, the robots cry.Hello, we are invited in from the beginning of David's track one on Starlite Walker. When we hear Berman talking to his dogs in the music as in the perfectly grilled Pretty Eyes from the Natural Bridge album, the climax of the song has the perfect tension of close comic strangeness and plain open just fell on my assness, in fact, becoming the same thing perfectly. The line is: \"I'd set my dog before a hoop and say 'now boy, now boy!' Of course it is one of several climaxes in the song. The song is not riddled with points so much as directions of various lines and types, off-ramps, and storms just circling wrecked kiosks.\"This Natural Bridge line perfectly marbles the gravity and the lightness of many Silver Jew tunes, one feels like the happiest jump-roper in the world that just fell asleep in their favorite place. When the rope is away, there is the sharp image of a German shepherd before a door of light reels backwards into your mind, the image is a piece of the album cover for the Tennessee EP, a recent release issued with the latest full length album Bright Flight. Both of these records will do more for your immune system than flax seed oil or even a lot of sleep.These and other related strings always scrabble around in my thoughts as soon as I am reminded of one of David's lines, or a cartoon drawing, a question found in one of his prose/poetic works, etc... This is what I love most of all about Berman's art. It is of course something hard to explain, as it is moving so fast under a tiny flashlight, connecting the dots.Particularly in the latest album, Bright Flight, the songs take on what is typically called an 'alt-country' flare. No need to wrestle with the total inadequacy of retail genres and their solidifying partners in crime, nor the wild difference of Berman and others who get slip-slapped into this small rabbit hole.People who hear the Silver Jews for the first time just light up like car lighter holes left by their lighter wives. I have seen this so many times on porches, and back yard parties, even in front of the tougher, teeming with leather jackets- Haagen-Dazs establishments (no joke). I will slip on a tape and rum for cigarettes.You get the pulse of the listener, as The Silver Jews lead them at their own pace into sometimes cold and puzzling song apartments with no mirrors, or too many, songs on the hill hamlets where moon and sun wrestle for contracts above. The songs invite people in as friends, as people.What sits ahead in this bit of writing are David's replies to a few other questions I tossed out to him by e-mail and by special headset accidents in late fall, early winter of 2002.:Q: Should ice-cream establishments continue to serve soft ice-cream in foot-ball helmets, or is America passed that? And are you pissed off about there being too many football teams in the NFL, even if you don't watch professional football much anymore?:DB: Funny you ask because a friend called yesterday and said he put a quarter in the little football helmet machine at Krogers and got a Colt's helmet. He regarded this as an omenn of a Colts' victory. I saw it more as the machine emitting the bland toxin from its body.The NFL's in good shape. I like the new divisions. Though I genuinely believe the Ravens pray to Satan, in the locker room before the game, holding hands. \"When I listen to music, I want to hear a person and a person that I trust. I don't want to hear the sound of a culture...\":Q: I love this quote from an older interview you did. This was in the context of lesbian folk music, and all its typical awful expressions and predictability. People imagine that the 'sound of a culture' only refers to pop music, or market driven 'culture industry' products in general, but you understand it to be just as symptomatic as the passive and pulse-less music coming from the so called underground or less aggressively 'different' pop music. Do you think this 'gaunt nonchalance' that prides itself on no-confrontation with a listener is more of a recent phenomenon in music, say the 90's up to today?:DB: Well they're just the stunted and lame offspring of the larger obstetric action. Bands are like politicians. You love the ones with charisma even if they go over the line like James Traficant or the Royal Trux. For the most part, the lifeless ones rise but occasionally, you get Teddy Roosevelt or Lou Reed.:Q: Have people's names, or retail shop signs 'out of the blue,' acted as creative trigger guns more so than 'lofty' stories or the like, in the creation or the glue of your songs sort-of-narrative compositions?:DB: In \"Trains Across the Sea,\" I mention a woman named Shady Sides. She lived next door to a friend in Charlottelsville. It was on the corner of Wine and Dice Streets in a rundown neighborhood. She had a senile mother who would come out in the middle of the night and stand in front of the gate with her purse hanging on the fence like she was waiting for a carraige.:Q: Why does the humor of Bobcat Goldthwaite seem unthinkable in the year 2002 as something to even remotely enjoy? Was it Sam Kinison's passing away, or is it that we as a nation have woken up to this 'all-over groggy-hyper ruse?' You've made note of the fact in intelligent ways, that certain comic motifs of yesteryear seem so naïve to contemporaries trying to get some laughs. Are there any recent comics in your community, or beyond, whose comedy transcends the dick-in-the-shoe obsolescence of it all?:DB: I was in L.A. last month for the first time. There was a map of the stars homes taped to the window of a convenience store. I jotted a few addresses down. Later on the sun was setting and I knew I only had time to see one. I fiddled with the city map and my list and after many twists and reverses found myself in front of Pauly Shore's place.:It was fairly big, dark brown and fronted by a high brown wooden fence with an arch exposing the front door and about a third of the front of the house. It was a rather gloomy complex compared to its neighbors. It was almost dark and the only light was a small window, like something out of a German fairy tale, about two by three, six feet of the ground, with an dark orange light coming through old glass.:It seemed like it stood for the fading of his career. It also seemed like it stood for the fading of my career. My very special thanks to Jason for his assistance in setting up the interview, and Lisa at Drag City Records, and of course to David Berman (thanks David). "

  "title": "Provincializm #13: Silver Jew, David Berman, Part Two",
  "body": "by William BowersCapsule summary of last week’s episode: Michael Tully made a documentary about The Silver Jews’ trip to Israel. Its chronicle of Silver honcho David Berman’s sincerity and religiosity might be traumatizing for some of his fan-children unhealthily committed to aping their projections/internalizations of Berman’s previous ever-buzzed, linguistic-trickster persona.“When I was younger I was a cobra: In every case I wanted to be cool.Now that I’m older and subspace is colder, I just want to say something true.”—from the Silver Jews’ “The Frontier Index”Okay Mr. Berman, but what are your slavish fans supposed to do as we age, especially if we lack the luxury of having been born into a faith we can take semi-seriously? Plus many of us have been educated and acculturated to find “truth” problematic. An apparent immunity to what my fellow South Carolinians considered satisfyingly “meaningful” enabled my absurd substitution of a fervor for 90s lo-fi recordings onto the altar where some other folks positioned spirituality or money or both or whatever in the first place. And Mr. Berman, many of your slavish fans, like you, are unblossoming into grownup-ness. We lately agree with you that cool detachment is a prophylactic against the immediacy of being an earthling. Our thrift-drag became our skin, too: we see what is totally out-of-place and yet kinda fitting about your wearing a trucker hat and a Western shirt to read and weep at Jerusalem’s Western Wall in Michael Tully’s film. (Take it from Grampa Polydenim, any nubile and impressionable column-skimmers out there, adulthood happens like this: For a deceptively extended interval you’re young and brilliant, young and drunk, young and sexy, young and high, and then—SHABAM—one afternoon you wake from a nap looking like Paul Westerberg.) In Wendy Fonarow’s attempt at indie-rock-anthropology Empire Of Dirt, she calls reaching the thirties a music-slut’s “sell by” date. Criminy. I’m at risk of ending up like that terrifying Onion headline: “Family Unsure What To Do With Dead Hipster's Possessions.” Please, God in whom I do not believe, permittest not a Tokyo Police Club promo to be playing when my heart attacks.All self-absorption aside: Good for David Berman. The film captures an artist who has beat his addictions, and who found a complementary life (and creative) partner. Fans will relish his band-origin stories, his explanation of his strategies for dealing with the press, and his lofty opining about religio-states. Non-fans can even enjoy the film’s bits touching on messianic delusion, women’s need to cover their tainted flesh at officially magical—I mean sacred—places, and the hassle of bargaining with local merchants. Most powerful is getting to watch Berman’s protective cynicism erode, as he curses his reluctance to feel in the 90s and is flooded by his audiences’ positivity. When he seems blown away by their being some of the “nicest people,” he rebaptizes that word—“nice” ceases to be descriptive styrofoam and is beautiful again, its benevolence radiant and legitimate. As Berman dives from the stage to hug crowdmembers, the viewer can’t resist imagining that he’s thanking them for saving this version of his life.Yet: watching someone with such a sharp mind talk so hippie-ly about receiving universal answers can be hard, especially if the viewer doubts that a near-suicide would rejigger their own theology-lobe. But religion was a major presence in Berman’s work all along: every album contains (retroactively portentous) references to Jewishness and Judeo-Christian mythology. Even his book of poetry begins with angels, hypothetically restages Christ’s deathplace, and ends with a Lord/God/Bible trifecta. Jesus is so prominent in Berman’s lyrics that I figured the songwriter to be due for a 1970’s-Dylan-style fundie trip. Ah well: I remember a review of Pavement in, like, Spin, which claimed that “Fight This Generation” was proof of how (original Silver Jew) Stephen Malkmus had gazed into the abyss so much that it was gazing back into him. Maybe Berman’s early work jokily looked too long at the light, and that’s why he now claims to have seen “God’s shadow on this world.” Hey, here’s a pitch: For the sequel 2 Silver 2 Jew: Return To Irony’s Bosom, Tully could catch Berman eating a Goliathburger at Orlando’s Jews-for-Jesus attraction The Holy Land Experience.Silver Jew has screened in Austin, Sarasota, Nashville, Boston, Glasgow, and London. It plays in Detroit November 3, and in Leeds on November 9 and 13. A DVD release is forthcoming via Drag City after the new Joos LP drops in February 2008."

  "title": "Interview with Verbal Rocket fanzine - 2007",
  "body": "Introduce yourself and your band please? Hello, I'm David, and this is the band: Peyton Pinkerton and William Tyler on guitar.Tony Crow, keyboards. Brian Kotzur: drums and my bass Cassie who plays wife. Are the band you tour with the band you are now recording with? Yes. I warmed them up for six months and then I let them rest a year. Next, I throw them in the studio with no time to prepare, then I disappear with the tapes and screen all their calls for 2-3 months. The earlier silver jews songs sounded like rough ideas which were quickly recorded, was that the case? That's it. 'Rough ideas. Quickly Recorded.' By the time of the time of the natural bridge all the songs were much more coherent and more 'perfectly formed', was there a turning point for you in terms of your song writing? The turning point was likely the city of Hartford, CT where the album was recorded. I don't want to tear down their city, but I think I was compelled to create these adjunct worlds to which I could flee to under stress. When did you move to Nashville and do you think moving there changed your music at all? 1998. I think it helped me to decide that music could be a lifelong art. The rock precedence is not promising in that regard. When recording the songs for the Arizona record, what were your influences? I only ask this because the first time I heard Jackson Nightz I was listening to music on shuffle and I thought I was listening to some early Sebadoh record. Well, definitely not Sebadoh! I'm sure both songs were influenced by the Daniel Johnston cassettes.Have you ever considered re-recording any of the songs off the Arizona record? Secret Knowledge of Backroads and Jackson Nightz in particular stand out to me on this record. I guess if I'm ever struggling for reasons to be relevant, you know touring 'American Water', etc. I might go lower. What was the inspiration behind 'I remember me'? Was it based on anything? It was based on a fear I had about losing my bass player. Purposely a little purple, the song was supposed to scare me in to getting married by painting an awful loneliness. When you felt low in what way did it affect your lyrics? Did you feel you became more reserved in what you wrote or did you find writing a way of expressing how you felt? Any depressing writing I've done, was mostly done in 'good times' looking back, mapping the contours of the bad times, delineating them, or extracting them via psychic surgery. Prior to touring I understand the only kind of gigs you played would be a few songs at parties. Was this true and if so can you give an account of what these performances were like?I got trapped into playing in a bar in Houston after it was closed. The owner had a guitar and when I said I didn't remember the chords or the words to any of my songs, he ran upstairs to his apartment and brought down a three ring binder with guitar tabs for all four albums.It has been 8 years since the publication of Actual Air, can we expect any more of your poetry to be published? That is something I need to think about more. With your writing, when you put pen to paper do you know what you're going to write? Or can a lyric turn into a poem into a story? If I make the decision to write something, it is to fulfil a need I have for a song or a poem. Someone needs a poem from me and I can't politely put it off anymore. I need two more songs to make an album. Dreaming up the content is the second step.I wouldn't be surprised if I learnt that you had written a novel, Is this something you'd be interested in doing? No, I think I prefer short forms. I don't consider prose fiction to be relevant anymore, anyway."

  "body": "== Provincializm: Hero, Worship (Part One) ==by William BowersIndulge me a quick hegira to Fanboyistan: I’m among the multitude of blokes who imagine themselves to have undergone an abstract discipleship involving Silver Jews frontman David Berman. We mail-order-chased him everywhere, beyond his discography’s slippery singles, compilation tracks and EPs: collecting his work for The Minus Times, stockpiling his band’s posters, shelving Robert Bingham publications that referenced/influenced him, deconstructing the significance of our drool on his book of poetry, “explaining” the band name to passersby curious about our tee-shirts’ ironic Zionism, etc. I once mistook a forwarded compliment from Berman regarding something that I’d typed more seriously than multiple marriage vows.Desperate completists still email me in hopes of obtaining a copy of a nonexistent Joos tome that I fauxcerpted. In issue #60 of No Depression, I even (unrigorously) attempted to define “Silver Jew” as a state of being, one worth striving to attain—it consisted of cultivating facial hair, donning Western thrift togs, keeping some peroxide in a Bank Of America koozie, treating people like cosmic glyphs through which one is supposed to glean cosmic empathy, and being all autumnal and confident. Drinks and drugs seemed crucial, too, later. Basically one was to approximate philosopher-palooka-tude by sitting around trying to come up with new canards. Y’know, like those goobers who emulate Hunter S. Thompson, but way/so loftier. Thus: watching Michael Tully’s film Silver Jew can be bittersweet, in that Berman is vividly mortalized while pursuing the eternal. Leave it to him to be the subject of a rockumentary best suited for screenings during an Anthropology Of Religion course.Indulge me a brief diary entry: Watching people sob is…my porn. It probably dates back to having to monitor Dad’s rope-bridges of grief-snot after my parents’ divorce, and then being sent outside to swing into my siblings via weeping willow branches. Anyway: I regularly conduct Google image searches for “sadness.” I Kodak-captured a mate exactly when I canceled our elopement. I relish Denzel Washington’s tears in Glory, Richard Griffith‘s breakdown in The History Boys, and Katerine Vauban’s sobpoint Polaroids during I Heart Huckabees. I’ll forever wonder, and wordlessly understand, why the Cenobites rip apart Andrew Robinson in the first Hellraiser for saying, “Jesus wept.” 1990 is my favorite Daniel Johnston album primarily because of how he loses it during the unrhyming, existential hymn “Careless Soul.” Unpathetic crying is, methinks, a behavioral holy grail. Deifiers of David Berman should be very afraid of Silver Jew, however: The film climaxes when our hero weeps for two minutes and fourteen seconds, his dignity intact.The reason Berman’s ducts unleash: religiosity, at the Western Wall, after which he takes a walk with his wife that makes heteronormativity seem, y’know, ordained, and which informed Tully’s video for “I’m Getting Back Into Getting Back Into You.” Silver Jew documents Berman’s time in Israel, playing two Tel Aviv shows and touring Jerusalem. Fans must be prepared to weather explanations of his puckish band name’s metastisization from Malkmus-esque goof into (gag) uncanny reverence…TO BE CONTINUEDSilver Jew has screened in Austin, Sarasota, Nashville, Boston, Glasgow, and London. It plays in Detroit November 3, and in Leeds on November 9 and 13. A DVD release is forthcoming via Drag City after the new Joos LP drops in February 2008."

  "title": "Cross Your Palms With Silver Jews",
  "body": "By Chris Nelson, from Addicted to Noise, Photos by David Berman.http://www.weeblackskelf.co.uk/cordsuit/img/drawings/madman.jpgThe Silver Jews' David Berman is \"inspired by the proximity to wealthy people\" but isn't exactly one of them himself. But that's the price you pay when aesthetics trumps royalties.\"I've always for some reason been inspired by the proximity to wealthy people,\" says David Berman, songwriter and guitarist for the Silver Jews.The county in Virginia that he currently calls home ought to provide plenty of inspiration. Living among Albemarle's denizens is one John Grisham, and Michael Crichton is rumored to be moving in. Sam Shepard and Jessica Lange also lived there until recently. Not that Berman shares a tax bracket with these neighbors. \"I just scrape by, really,\" says Berman. While Silver Jews records have garnered plenty of critical praise, they don't fully pay the bills. Berman covers expenses by occasionally writing articles, or by taking odd jobs here and there. \"There's a guy in town who owns an ice cream truck company,\" he says, \"and every once in a while, I'll drive an ice cream truck for him.\"If wealth was Berman's motivation, he would not have dropped members of Pavement from the Silver Jews to record the band's new album, a quiet, country-ish release called The Natural Bridge. In the early '90s, Pavement's Steve Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich joined Berman to put out the first Silver Jews records, a single and EP on Chicago's Drag City label.Pavement released its highly acclaimed debut Slanted & Enchanted in '92, and then the Silver Jews resumed work to produce their own full-length debut, Starlight Walker. In the years since the release of that disc, Pavement released Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain and Wowee Zowee and in the process became still more popular, not only in indie circles, but also in the popular press.So why did Berman abandon his work with Malkmus and Nastanovich at the point when Pavement's name is carrying its biggest cache ever? Because in Berman's world, aesthetics trumps royalties. After all, we're talking about a guy with no aversion to driving an ice cream truck on odd days if it allows him to pursue his art with purity.In October of 1995, Berman, Malkmus, and Nastanovich went to Memphis to pursue the next Silver Jews record. Berman brought several songs with him for the band to work on, but the session fell apart almost immediately.\"I didn't like it after the first day,\" says Berman. \"We were there for eight hours, and after one day, I knew it was wrong, the vibe was wrong, and it sounded wrong. The music was belying the intent of the songs,\" he explains. \"It was coming out almost like heavy metal to me. It was really rocking too hard. I didn't feel like it was anyone's fault. If it was anyone's, it was mine because I couldn't get enough focus together to change and explain what I wanted to be different.\"Berman's urge to abort the session flew in the face of his lifelong determination to never quit, a goal he attributes to his being a slow learner. \"In everything I've ever done, I've always taken longer than everyone else,\" he says. But what some might consider a drawback, Berman has come to view as a gift in disguise. \"I've realized as I've gotten older that in the lag time I was gaining something, like feeling or desire, so that when I could get some skills together, it would help me.It gave a dimension that maybe I would have been too scattered to see if I was adept at everything I picked up.\"As Berman describes the scrapped session, he \"hadn't really lived the songs\" that he and the Pavement folks were attempting to record. \"They were all pretty sad compared to what I'd written before.\" It turns out that the abhorrent experience of quitting the session provided the spark for Berman's to finish the creation. \"It's always been a question of honor for me not to be a quitter, but I was that day,\" he says in a typically harsh self-analysis. \"Through those dark months that followed, I actually found a hold on the songs and was able to write a couple more to fill the record out.\" Thus, in a round-about, painful way, Berman generated the lag time that he was accustomed to as a slow learner, and was able to continue working on the album.http://www.weeblackskelf.co.uk/cordsuit/img/drawings/superjoo.jpgNow that he had the proper material, Berman needed a band to record it. First he enlisted his old friend and Drag City employee Rian Thomas Murphy to play drums. Murphy has also played drums with Royal Trux, Smog, and Palace, and is credited as producer on The Natural Bridge. \"I knew that I wanted a kind of producer, someone who would have sound ideas, and Rian's really good at that.\" Berman knew guitarist Peyton Pinkerton and bass player Matt Hunter from when he lived in Massachusetts. \"I knew that I could just send them a demo tape. They would be able to write some parts that weren't intrusive and that were true to the music...it was very easy.\"(In case you're wondering how Malkmus and Nastanovich felt about the project, Berman says that at first they didn't understand his frustration with the recording. \"From the outside in, it just looked like I was freaking out,\" he admits, \"like I was having a nervous breakdown.\" Berman says that his former bandmates were disappointed, \"but we're all friends.They were understanding. They were gentlemanly about it.\")\"Dallas\" is one of the original songs that Berman was able to find a hold on after the aborted session, and is also one of the numbers that was influenced by his proximity to wealth. \"Dallas in the '80s, especially in the early '80s, was a real boomtown. There was a lot of ostentatious wealth.\" At the time when his family lived there, Berman was a teenager. \"I was just old enough to start to make sense of what was happening,\" he says, \"but young enough to just soak it all in.\" The song \"Dallas\" is Berman's attempt to fathom what was an overwhelming environment for him as young man. \"One way you can turn the tables on a city or a place or a person is to write a song, and to render it in the imagination your own, and control it that way.\"Berman's thoughtfulness about his own work reflects his period of study at the University of Massachusetts, where he was enrolled in the graduate creative writing program. He says that writing poetry is different for him than composing songs. \"I can't just put down a pen and pick up a guitar. I have to switch gears, and sometimes that takes days. But the end result sometimes looks the same. Content-wise, there really doesn't seem to be much of a difference.\"He understands his growth a songwriter within that familiar context of slow learning. \"When I was 19 or 20, I bought a used guitar from a guy.... I started a band here in Charlottesville with some friends, but I didn't really start writing songs--that was just a bunch of noise. I didn't really start writing songs until I was, maybe, 22, when I started to think of songs as wholes. And then I didn't even start to think of albums as pieces, and how songs fit together, and continuity until I was 25 or 26.\" (Berman is now 29.)Details have come to be an important ingredient in his work. Berman considers details to be entryways into his songs. \"If a song is a room, then the details are like extra doors. I draw the door, and hopefully whoever's listening to it can walk through it if they want.\" The songs on The Natural Bridge were wrought using real life places, other people's song titles within songs, and TV show names. \"Ballad of a Reverend War Character\" is actually about several characters, enough to make the song Berman's own \"Desolation Row.\" Other pieces contain careful, poetic description, such as this lyric from \"Black and Brown Blues\": \"When I go downtown/I always wear a corduroy suit/cause it's made of a hundred gutters/that the rain can run right though.\"It's probably no surprise that when asked about his inspirations, David Berman is more likely to rattle off a string of authors than a list of bands. He takes special pleasure from writers such British novelist Nicholas Mosely and John Ashbury. Berman notes that he didn't start listening to rock and roll until well into his teens when his cousin introduced him to bands such as X and Black Flag. \"That was the first music I could accept, and buying into it [meant] you almost had to sign a contract that said you hated classic rock.\" These days, Berman is backtracking to learn about groups such as Led Zeppelin and Moby Grape, though he also digs new outfits like Royal Trux and the Dirty Three.In light of his deep affection for books of poetry and fiction, it makes sense that Berman is more interested in creating albums than he is in touring. \"Maybe it's because I came to [music] so late in life,\" he explains, \"but music is not in my blood. It is to sit around and play, but it's not to perform in front of people.\" Berman sees the live recreation of albums as a falsehood for him as a songwriter. Although he's not touring in support of The Natural Bridge, he nonetheless hopes to go on the road eventually. \"I haven't found a way to present myself that I can be satisfied with,\" he says, \"a way to do a concert that would be useful and truthful. I can't go onstage and act, I can't play a role--but I have to when I play live. It's not in me to be a rock musician, it's not in me to be onstage and be the center of attention. I wasn't raised that way, it's not in my genes. I'm supposed to be off to the side watching.\"Berman notes that he has no trouble reading his poetry in front of people, because during a reading he can feel the effect he is having. \"I need that, I need to feel the bridge between the audience and the stage.\" But while he doesn't like to put on concerts, he says that he enjoys being in a concert audience himself very much. \"It's not alienating on the other end. I don't expect any contact with the musician when I'm listening to music.\"Perhaps the lead Silver Jew is simply being harder on himself than he is on others, as he is certainly wont to do. But while he hasn't yet found a way to mount a satisfying tour, don't expect Berman to stop trying anytime soon. Quitting is out of the question. "

  "title": "David Berman and Stephen Malkmus Interview",
  "body": "http://www.weeblackskelf.co.uk/cordsuit/img/photos/dcbsm.jpgThe setting was perfect for the Silver Jews' David Berman and Stephen Malkmus to trade stories of days before \"indie rock happened.\"Those were the days spent sprawled out on friend Bob Nostanovich's floor among \"a total holocaust of clothes and cigarette butts and empty cans.\" Those were the days of making racket in Ectoslavia, a free-noise project Berman lovingly calls \"a wall-of-shit-type thing.\" Those were also the days before Malkmus and Nostanovich started a band called Pavement that would release Slanted and Enchanted (Matador), the landmark album that caused a microcosmic explosion in 1992 and revealed indie rock's allure as the new big thing to legions of imitators. And most importantly, those were the days when Berman and friends put out the first Silver Jews EP, Dime Map of the Reef (Drag City, 1991).The two old friends from the University of Virginia are sitting in a booth at the Cedar Bar, the mythic swill house in New York's Greenwich Village where 1950s Abstract Expressionist artists like Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline threw back almost as many punches as shots of whiskey. The Cedar was once a downtown bohemian depot where friends were less than friendly and inspiration was served as if from the bar's tap.Sounds like an American Express commercial, I know, but the legend fits the scene; and judging from their stories, the two Jews lapped it up like it was the \"American Water\" that gives their new album on Drag City its name. The inspiration Berman and Malkmus draw from each other is of a particularly demanding sort, and Berman's body of songs and poetry has made him an Abstract Expressionist in his own right-with the emphasis on \"expressionist.\"You wouldn't take a song called \"We Are Real\" as a revelation, but in the context of indie rock, where irony has often been taken as truth and apathy its pathway to success, it can amount to a pillar-shaking declaration. When Berman sings \"We've been raised on replicas of fake and winding roads/ and day after day on this beautiful stage/ we've been playing tambourine for minimum wage/ but we are real, I know we are real,\" he does so with an earnestness impossible to ignore. Not impassioned beauty, mind you-his affectless vocals make all the better the song's earlier line, \"All my favorite singers couldn't sing\"-but there's an honesty in the song that makes Berman a real keeper in a lake full of cynical bony fish.Berman's lyrics garner close attention, in part because he's an accomplished poet published in literate journals like The Baffler and Open City, but also because in his songs lie simple truths poetry often struggles to confront. \"In the band I can be more bare emotionally because it's not embarrassing to show your emotions in music,\" he says. \"Music butters people up for honest truths in a way that makes them more comfortable with some things that are maybe even maudlin.\"While there is a definite push to the words, the songs themselves tug on the reins. The Silver Jews music is undeniably casual, strolling with a sort of bow-legged amble down the roads of country, indie rock, and folk. This wasn't always the case, though. The Jews' debut album, 1993's The Arizona Record (Drag City), was a slab of tape hiss and false starts. But the band quickly cleaned up its act, and next year's Starlite Walker (Drag City) repositioned the Silver Jews as the beautifully understated band they are today.American Water marks the return of guitarist/singer Malkmus, who sat out on 1996's The Natural Bridge (Drag City). His presence is plastered all over the new songs, from his wry vocals to his instantly recognizable guitar style on a song like \"Night Society,\" a raucous instrumental that could double as one of Pavement's own.\"When Stephen plays guitar on my songs,\" Berman says. \"I feel like he's trying to play something more simple and tender. Basically, I think it's him trying to play what I would play if I were a good lead guitarist. If you're a leader in a band like he is, it's a fantasy to be the silent Keith Richards archetype, a musical animal who can slither around like a panther and just be instinctual.\"As Malkmus' influence comes in and out of focus, those panther-like movements give the music a charge when it needs one or a bit of respite when it doesn't. And the ease of the two old friends' musical pairing gives the songs as much soul as Berman's words. That can be a tall order at times, but when it pays off, indie rock hasn't been so invigorating in years.Maybe this is what Berman is singing about when he croons, \"Won't soul music change/ now that our souls have turned strange.\" As legions of followers trade guitars and songs for samplers and breaks, delusions of indie rock changing the world have faded, but that only cracks the door for modest yet ambitious records like American Water all the more. And Berman, for one, makes handy use of what he called this new \"breathing space.\"\"I feel like rock 'n' roll is so fucking exciting right now,\" he says. \"Everything you read says the opposite. People can quit or give up, but when people stick around because they have something to say, they start to say it really loudly.\" "

  "title": "Poetic Contradictions With Actual Air",
  "body": "by Chris Nelson, from SonicnetSinger/songwriter David Berman reads from poetry collection at Chicago bookstore, talks shop.CHICAGO - Silver Jews leader David Berman, in town to give a poetry reading, sat straight-backed in the tiny Chinese eatery with nothing before him but a Corona that he had poured into a juice glass.It was an odd juxtaposition - not only the beer in the juice glass, but the Mexican beer in an Asian restaurant.But then, Berman lives and breathes such contradictions - at least in his poetry.\"I think the real unit of a poem is phrases,\" said Berman, the singer, songwriter and guitarist whose first book of poetry, \"Actual Air,\" was published in June. \"Most specifically, a noun modified by an adjective that you've never seen it modified with before.\" Fans of Berman's will recognize one such phrase in the Silver Jews' album title American Water. That 1998 disc included such songs as \"Blue Arrangements\" and \"Random Rules\".\"Once I was in school and a teacher said, 'There aren't any interesting verbs in [this poem]. You always seek interesting object descriptions, but I guess you're not interested in describing action in a new way,' \" Berman, 32, recalled in a deep, gentle voice.\"My poems are like miniatures. They're real still. There's not left hooks and speeding trains and stuff. They always seem boxed in.\"That stillness pervades \"Actual Air\" even more thoroughly than Berman's work with Silver Jews, a band whose revolving membership often includes Pavement singer Steve Malkmus. Snowfall sets the scene in several of the poems.\"When it's snowing, the outdoors seem like a room,\" Berman writes in the opening piece, \"Snow.\" He maintains the intimacy but turns the image inside out in \"If There Was a Book About This Hallway,\" referring to a favorite passageway as \"an outdoors that is somehow indoors.\"\"The Spine of the Snowman\" plays again with incongruities, as an old caretaker explains to a robot that when snowmen melt, they sometimes reveal inner constructions, such as a gourd for an organ or a stick for a spine.\"The robot shifted uncomfortably in his chair,\" Berman writes, striking the reader with the disconcerting notion that some things are so odd as to make even a heartless being squirm.During his 20-minute poetry reading at Barbara's Bookstore in the Old Town neighborhood, Berman's six-foot-three-inch frame loomed tall under a neon sign for the \"Kid's Books\" section. He explained that references to middlebrow authors Isaac Asimov and James Michener in several of his poems are not meant as irony.\"You get it wrong if you think it's a joke - about so many things,\" he told the audience of about 40 fans.Earlier, smoking a cigarette outside the store, Berman said Silver Jews' three albums had provided enough income to subsidize a non-lucrative poetry career. He isn't generally paid for readings such as this one, and he had to foot the airfare from his home in Nashville.Perhaps that's why he looked unceremonious in an army-surplus shirt, with a five-o'clock shadow and unwashed, barely combed hair. Might as well be comfortable for a gig that's not even paying.Songwriting is not only more profitable but also typically easier than writing poetry, said Berman, who studied poetry at the University of Massachusetts.\"If I write a song, I usually start out with the music and then write words to fit into those cadences. I can go anywhere when I sit down with a blank piece of paper [to write a poem]. But the flip side of that freedom is there's a lot more pressure. The limits of songwriting are actually very helpful.\"Joe Williams, a 21-year-old fan, was first drawn to Berman's work through Silver Jews' albums. He bought \"Actual Air\" when it was first published in June and drove six hours on Thursday from Ames, Iowa, to hear Berman read.\"It's kind of like audience-participation poetry, where you know what he means,\" Williams said. \"In my own mind, there's no doubt that I know what he's saying or I know what he's trying to convey. It makes it stick with you that much more. A lot of what he's saying is relatable and straightforward enough that you really walk away feeling like he told you something.\" "

  "title": "Don't Fall For the Traps of the Man Who Was Never Born",
  "body": "An introduction to an interview with poet and Silver Jew, David Berman\\By Adalena Kavanagh''This piece first appeared in Tally Ho Sulky, a lovingly written and produced fanzine by Adalena Kavanagh. If you would like a copy of Tally Ho Sulky in its entirety, please email 5redpandas AT gmail.com. When I conducted this interview back in October of 1997 I was young enough to be excited, but not exactly surprised that I was granted the opportunity to spend a day with one of my heroes, David Berman. I decided I wanted to interview Berman—I was not, and still am not, affiliated with any publication— so I wrote him a letter and hoped he’d agree to sit and answer my questions. When I returned from a family vacation in Texas I received a postcard from Berman explaining that he’d be in New York representing Drag City at CMJ and he was available for an interview session. I was given a phone number to call on the specified date and I did as I was instructed.When I first called a strange man answered and had fun with me. This man would later turn out to be Drag City’s Dan Koretsky and he told me that a man was impersonating David Berman and sullying his good name and they had to be careful about who they let speak to Berman. After a bit of this the phone was passed over to a croaking Berman. He was warm and casual and explained his scratchy voice by saying he’d stayed up too late drinking and smoking. We discussed plans to meet and I was told I could find Berman at Florent on Gansevoort Street in the meatpacking district in Manhattan \"with a red carnation in my buttonhole\".On my way to the restaurant I walked past my first transvestite hooker. I was nervous. I’d never interviewed anyone before and I was less self-assured when I was 19 than I am now at 27. Despite my shyness I consciously sought out experiences that would change my life. I was happy.When I reached the table that Berman sat at I was surprised to see several other unshaved men sitting around a table eating the remnants of a late breakfast. Berman politely introduced me to Dan Koretsky, DV DeVincentis, David Pajo and Will Oldham. I sensed that I was interrupting something so I quietly sat as a waiter filled a glass with water for me.Dan Koretsky posed for a picture with Will Oldham holding a wad of crisp bills fanned out in front of his face. Berman explained to me that Koretsky always made you take a picture with the cash he’d loaned you for proof of the exchange. Oldham jumped up after the photo was taken and left with Pajo to go record shopping. After they left Berman and Koretsky began arguing about expenses Berman had incurred on his trip to New York City. Berman wanted to be reimbursed and Koretsky was giving him a hard time. He sat back in his seat in a khaki safari vest and yellow tinted aviator sunglasses. With his bushy beard and taunting eyes he had the look of a man affecting a Hunter S. Thompson look so as to make strong-arming his record label’s roster easier for him. It seemed like he was having himself a good time playing the asshole record executive. He asked Berman, \"You have any receipts for the taxi from Newark? I’m gonna need to see the receipt.\" Berman first insisted he had receipts but then became exasperated at Koretsky’s smile and complained, \"You know I don’t. Just give me the money.\"I was uncomfortable watching this exchange and was relieved when we stood up to leave. We were headed over to Other Music on Fourth Street. There was a slight bit of controversy because Drag City had paid for a window display for the then newish Silver Jews record The Natural Bridge, but the Jewish owner of the space that Other Music leased had supposedly seen the advertisement and decided that the band name Silver Jews was anti-Semitic. Even when it was explained that the principle member of the band, David Berman, was himself Jewish the owner insisted that the advertising be taken down. This incensed both Koretsky and Berman to a point where on the way to Other Music they planned to storm the store and make a fuss. Somewhere between Florent and Other Music Berman picked up a large rubber band and a single tennis ball on the street and carried these items with him.When we reached Other Music Marcellus Hall’s band, White Hassle, were finishing up a set they played outside the store. After some small talk he packed up his equipment and left. Koretsky went inside to talk to Other Music people while Berman chatted with a woman from the P.R. company Drag City used. She had a toddler with her and Berman first offered him the rubber band, then the tennis ball and finally his driver’s license and credit card. The kid refused all. He seemed unnervingly humorless for a three year old.Instead of creating a commotion Berman suggested we go to the Strand. The next summer I found a job at the Strand among the refuse that sought employment there—the former junkies, trannies, and would be artists—and watched while they engaged in the co-dependent relationship the Strand fostered among its staff. The store gave $50 credit on the week’s paycheck, which really helped the drug addicts on staff cop their fixes, but never allowed them to move beyond the comfortable den they’d made for themselves amidst the 80 miles of books. As you walk into the Strand you meet a bored college kid manning the bag check. Berman checked his tennis ball and rubber band (now wound around the ball) and asked the clerk what was the strangest thing he’d checked. The guy mentioned a rotisserie chicken, and satisfied with his answer, Berman walked into the store. I followed him around as he plucked books from the piles and listened to his pronouncements on the books—\"A Confederacy of Dunces\" was panned and \"Underworld\" by Delillo was bought. Berman worried about his next credit card statement but bought the pile anyway.After the shopping we walked north to the hotel room he was sharing with other Drag City people. We passed the gated garden in Gramercy Park and admired the foliage we could only look at. We stopped at a corner deli where Berman purchased an iced tea and a nectarine. He offered to buy me a snack but I politely refused. We’d been talking the whole time, and the circuit from Gansevoort Street back up to the East 20’s was a long one, but we had not yet begun the actual interview. I feel lucky to have spent the day with a writer and musician I respect as much as I respect David Berman. We talked about music and writing—I was a writing major at the time and felt self conscious about my work—and there was never a point where Berman made me feel like a kid or patronized me. Instead of turning me off to writers he made me feel like I was just one of many eccentric individuals with the goal of telling stories in the form that best suited us. I shared some of my stories with him—I always used story telling as a way to relate to people—and he commented that some of them sounded like Raymond Carver’s work. I’m still working on those stories, I’m a slow learner, but I do think that in a small but important way talking to Berman made me see that if they were important to me they might be important to others.In the interview that follows Berman talks about music and writing—more so about writing, which is why I think this particular interview is a departure from the norm—and I hope his warmth and unpretentious gentility comes across because to a 19 year old girl from New York City he was a perfect gentleman.== David Berman Interview — NYC October 1997 ==(a= Adalena Kavanagh, d= David Berman)David: You could read too much into it already. You want to interview somebody so let’s say you’re going to interview this musician, let’s say his name is David. But, from the start, number 1) I don’t feel like a musician unless there is a guitar in my hand or I happen to be writing now, or even like walking through the grocery store humming something. So if I’m here like this weekend what I feel like is a guy on vacation seeing some old friends blah, blah, blah. So unless it's a documentary about high school reunions then I’m already in a weird position. So basically what I feel like I have to do to do an interview today I would have to go back to who I was in November which is the last time I did a series of interviews. So let’s say in November I did 100 interviews in one month, and then in December I did 10, January 5 the next month 2. So for the next six months not do one and in those six months I was able shave my beard off which I grew to do interviews. You know when they say, don’t trust a man with a beard, he has something to hide, well you know I never know if that was true or nota: is it true?d: yeah, it gives you a foot of personal space, even though it’s actually a centimeter coming off your face but in your mind it feels like people are back an extra foot. I grew that because an album was coming out and I would be in the unnatural position of having to talk about myself. Let’s say x calls me up and says let’s go out tonight some friends of mine are in town. I go out and am introduced and I feel the obligation when we sit down to immediately make a person like me so I take care to learn their name, smile, shake their hand firmly, maybe do a few things someone can call me on, maybe be more ingratiating than someone who considers himself more honest. Like Dan (Koretsky) for instance or Will (Oldham) definitely would not make some of the efforts, emotional or certain kinds of deportment. But for whatever reason I feel this need to say, make within five minutes, this person like me and then I can relax. So there are certain things you learn from your father or whoever you choose to learn from. You do those things whatever it takes and then you start asking them questions, that’s the easiest way. So why do you do that and why did you make that and instead of absorbing answers you also have to show that you were really hearing by saying \"yeah I can see why you did that...\" but basically you’re trying to express the fact that you are learning from them and in an interview situation you can try and turn the tables whatever be cutesy and ask the other person questions. \"I’m not into a star trip, blah blah blah.v But in reality it’s not until after the tape recorder goes off that you get to be just yourself. In that case being myself with another person is being a listener and an understanderer or something. So I can’t do that interview. So is that a long answer to your question \"what do you want to talk about\".a: no that’s fine.d: no, it’s all this iced tea.a: does it get you excited?d: yeah it really does. I have a really low resistance to caffeine. If I drank a cup of coffee at ten in the morning at 2 at night I’d be up still and wired walking around. If I sit down to write in the morning I take a can of coke and I put it in one of those koosh containers to keep it cold because it lasts six hours. If I can make it six hours at the desk I’ll only get to the ¾ mark and I put it in the refrigerator and that night when I need a little extra kick to get me through Conan O’Brien I’ll drink that last ¼ of the can and that will take me to bedtime.a: Is there anything you need to do to get you started writing?>d: Yeah, there’s a couple techniques. First of course the Coca-Cola in the morning, I get up and do two or three things but not do so many things that you’ve already gotten in utilitarian anthropolominalogical(?) mode like making a phone call or doing too many tasks. Just do enough to shake the cobwebs out but keep enough in that there’s some stratus, (that’s the word lattice, lattice work still on your point of view) and then sit down and say I don’t have a thought in my mind I don’t know what I want to write about. But, evidently, the French writer, Raymond Quinos said if you can write twenty lines a day of prose fiction, whatever, that’s good, that’s very good. So at the very minimum my rule for myself is I have to fill up two pages of legal pad a day and I allow myself to let it be bad. You have to because if you just sit there and you’re playing critic and writer at the same time it’s too slow. So you allow yourself to write bad things even if you want to scratch them out. Open a dictionary to a page, take a word, put words around it. Open up books, hold it two or three feet away from my face and race my eyes across the page and wait for me to read something wrong. I’ll read a sentence put an extra R into a word, change the meaning of a sentence, do that four or five times until something good comes. Write that down, write five sentences around it. These are just things for when there’s nothing coming. Get a book of poetry, pick up the book, read the poem, figure out what’s wrong with it, what you don’t like about it. Read it again, take the first line, improve it, take the second line, improve it, and improve it three times over until it’s enough away from it so you’re not stealing or borrowing and just make it yours. Just kickstart stuff and you’ve got a half a page of stuff to work with. That stuff is for you, someone else might look at it but it’s going to be like droppings or something so then you think of an audience or you think of a friend or someone who likes what you do and you think, \"I’m going to make them laugh\", or \"I’m going to make them cry\" or something and then you just start writing.a: Do you have something specific you want the reader to get from your writing?d: The word in the question that makes me say no is ‘specific’. It’s an accident, the writing’s not an accident, but what the person gets is an accident. I have what I want from it. Here’s a perfect example: sometimes I read people talking about their writing. Especially sometimes you see a lot of this with musicians and someone will say \"oh what does this lyric mean\" and the person says \"Oh I don’t interpret my lyrics because I want people to think what they want to think.\" I grant people the right to think what they want to think but I have something yes, of course, oh I want them to think this and I can tell you this is what I meant and this is what I was thinking of and this is what it means to me. I could never say to someone, if someone came up and said \" what did you mean by that?\" I would never say \"I leave it up to the reader\". That’s just touchy feely and it’s also like a cop out because a lot of people don’t know what they meant and they don’t even bother to go back and think about what they meant.  Or what it might mean to someone else.d: Right, and so they throw some words together and they’re like, \" I leave it up to the reader...\" and they’re hoping the reader can find something. Anyone can find anything. You can take meaning from anything. I used to play this game when I six or seven years old when I couldn’t sleep and I was first getting into words and I first realized that words had their own life and I would lie in bed and challenge myself and take two words or two nouns and try to find two you couldn’t connect in a sentence and the fun part of the game was that I couldn’t.:someone threw out the words peach and nuclear and David came up with this sentence: We went down to the peach bowl in Atlanta to see Arkansas play Clemson and we had a hotel room with a view of a nuclear reactor\"d: You can’t do it and that’s the beauty of it. The language has that built into it and it’s all interconnected and that’s what’s so fun because you just have to find it. That’s why I’m also so into nouns since nouns all share the same space or the same world or same universe they’re all necessarily able to beinterconnected through verbs and all the qualifiers. Any two in the world so everything is completely interrelated through language. An ocean on Neptune is completely related to this bed. They have a spatial relationship, they have a color relationship, etc. but you have to make it with the language, an animal can’t make it. That’s what I want to do. That’s what I like to do in the morning when I wake up. Use words and make everything together and remind yourself that everything isn’t flying apart and things aren’t cold. Do you remember we were in the record store today and we were talking about how there is this low level angry vibe in a cool record store and that makes you feel like you’re being told you need to get out? The work that someone is doing on the records, if they’re doing a good job, in that record store is an opposite and equal force. That’s the weirdest part about it. Maybe there is some universal psychic balance happening. The same thing happens in an art museum, here you are and people can go look at a Mark Rothko and my gf can actually get emotional over a Mark Rothko (I can’t, but I can appreciate it) and actually be brought to tears by an abstract painting and nothing else in the art museum is encouraging you at all to feel. The employees, the architecture, the light, nothing is. Bookstores, places where you go for art, where you go to buy and experience human feelings or works of humans and art, they are all mean and alienating places.a: You said you don’t feel like a musician unless you have a guitar in your hand. What’s the difference between why you do one thing over the other? It seems you have more exposure being a musician than as a writer. Is there one that you hold dearer or are they both on the same level?d: Well we were talking about this the other day and the dream is—and it’s not the post-modern one of bric-a-brac and combining different art forms and multi media stuff. In the 1800’s and 1700’s you could be a renaissance man and you could know everything and I think it was Thomas Jefferson or someone earlier who had read every book in the world. That was a possible thing to do in the 1700’s. Thomas Jefferson was able to do so many things in so many fields and be a little bit better than just a jack of all trades. Nowadays everything encourages you to specialize. People are drawn to smaller and smaller corners. I go to a party and I meet a guy who studies the heads of pins and I meet another guy who works for a remote control factory and then I meet a lady who is a painter but she paints exclusively in the color blue. So you’re at this party and you’re meeting all these people and someone comes up to you and asks you what you do so you have this choice (you in this case is me) \"oh I’m a writer, oh I’m a musician\" well there’s all that baggage. Here I am talking to the guy who studies heads of pins for a living and I’m interested in what he does but for me to tell him that I’m a writer and musician, number 1, even if I was pretending to be specialized that’s so fucking vague. And you don’t trust anyone who says that. Never trust anyone who says that. Never eat anywhere called \"Mom’s\" and don’t trust me.DV DeVincentis: Also you can’t trust what image people have in their minds when you say writer. When you say writer you’re releasing responsibility of description in their minds of what you are and that can be so many things to them.d: Yeah and I’m not wearing a seatbelt. (laughter)a: I described a teacher I had who only talked about writing in the context of drinking or drugging and we got a bit on the myth of writers> That whole disorientation of the senses thing that Rimbaud started or at least he announced it since people were disorienting their senses but he’s the first person to claim that it was a necessity or something at least for him has already been proven many times over to be true for certain individuals and it also has been proven to be true that people like that burn out and coast on really bad work well into their old age like Wordsworth and Bob Dylan and what really bothers me is people who allow that to happen. People like your teacher or people who would give someone like Neil Young way more credit than he deserves for bad music because of what he did before. And to walk around in Windermere thinking every word that comes out of your mouth is mountain dew. Like when R.E.M. comes out with a new album, for every new album, they always say \"yeah I really think this is the best album we’ve done since...\". I’m always amazed at the distance of what their perception of what they’re doing is and me the average fan perceives them to be doing. What I find scary is someone who wants to keep making things. Right now I’m lined up with what I’m doing, I’m very aware of what’s strong and what’s flawed with what I do. I’m afraid one day I will lose that because we were talking when you’re writing and you’re imagining your audience and you’re playing to a friend that you’re playing to or writing to and it keeps you true. Those guys have lost touch with that first person they were thinking of when they wrote the song, their gf or something, and they’ve lost touch with their audience not in the way you usually say lost touch with their audience but they’ve lost touch in the sense that they can’t hear their music like the audience can hear it, anymore and then it’s bad. That’s when they start to suck.a: You had a line like \"Now that I’m older I just want to say something true.\" It’s such a simple line but for some reason that’s the line that sticks out in my mind. We were talking about irony and the different kinds of irony and I was wondering if you really believe that line.>d: Well I probably always want to have it both ways. What I hear most commonly about the silver jews songs is \"you know it’s strange, the songs are funny and they’re sad.\" Sometimes they’re sad and funny at the same time sometimes a section is funny or sad but you never tip the scale too much to one side or the other. I guess that comes from the only way I know how to try to be as smart as I can be but also be benign. In a sense I think growing up in the 80’s a lot of humor was ironic and speech just became ironic, American speech was ironic and it was sharp edged and there was submerged anger in it and I liked it when I was growing up but it became tiring and it wasn’t practically useful for situations I found myself in when I needed to speak.d: This might sound funny but I found watching Conan O’brien, when he first started, (and I still watch him), to have been in a lot of ways a watershed in the culture in that he took whatever David Letterman started in the ‘80s, who I really blame for that kind of nihilistic irony of the ‘80s spreading through the culture, I don’t want to say blame, but I locate it in him and his powerful sense of humor. Conan bridged a gap between intelligence and kindness that I hadn’t really seen before. I started to watch it and I found it to be inspiring and comforting, funny and touching. All the things I would like songs to be like, obviously not weighed so much towards joking and humor like Conan O’Brien but the intentions were clear. So when I say something like, \"I just want to say something true\", I mean that. I mean that. It’s like I told you before, sometimes I have to lie to say something true, sometimes I have to deflect emotion through humor to say something true and sometimes you have to be balls-out-sentimental to say something true.a: It’s harder to say what you really mean. Do you feel sometimes you have to create a new persona? You talked about interviews and now you say you grew a beard and everything... You said you can’t trust someone who has a beard, but most people who grow a beard they just grow a beard. It seems like you just grew a beard so you could have an excuse.d: Yes. But most people just grow a beard because they grow a beard. Some people grow a beard for entirely practical reasons-like it makes my face look fuller or some guy got a knife cut-but I think a truism like that, I stand by that. You can go down on the street and everybody has something to hide. I think of a lot of academics with beards. You see a lot of rock musicians with beards. People who are in front of people on a daily basis, performing for people, receiving the attention of all those eyes, whether it’s 20 kids in a classroom or a thousand people in a honky tonk. I stick by that. You’re not going to change my mind. ? "

  "title": "This Ain't No Side Project",
  "body": "By Marc Hawthorne for Fizz Magazine, November 94    It's nice to have friends in high places, but there's always a catch. Just ask David Berman, lead singer/songwriter and founding member of the Silver Jews.    When he start the band with a couple of college buddies in the late 80's, nobody gave the band much thought. But now that the others two members of the Silver Jews - Steve Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich - have made quite a name for themselves with the almighty Pavement, people have started to take notice. Problem is, people won't stop comparing them with Pavement. Berman figures it's inevitable, but the popular misconception that the Silver Jews is some sort of Pavement side project is really starting to bug him.    Nevertheless, the band just recently released their first full-length album, entitled Starlite Walker, on Drag City. Eleven songs full of quirky melodies, unorthodox lyrics and folk-driven passion, Starlite Walker is sure to set people straight about the ability of the Silver Jew's material to stand proudly on its own.    But don't expect the Silver J. train to come rumbling through your town anytime soon, because a live band they are not.    This interview took place sometime in the afternoon during the middle of last November [1994]. Though very soft-spoken, the head Jew had quite a bit to say.M: Marc HawthorneD: David BermanM: Who all is in the Silver Jews?D:     The core members are me, Bob Nastanovich and Malkmus. And we sometimes play with [Pavement drummer] Steve West, so I guess in the end, the constant member are me, and Malkmus and Nastanovich, but I'm actually doing a recording with some other people under the name Silver Jews, so that doesn't mean anything anymore anyway.M:    Who are you recording with?D:     It's a band up here that are this amazing band that I'm a really big fan of, and I just want to record with them for the hell of it.M:    What are they called?D:     They're called the Scud Mountain Boys. They're this local band that is just incredible.M:    So no matter who you record with, you're gonna call yourselves the Silver Jews?D:     It's weird because, the Silver Jews, unlike a band that come together just for the purpose of becoming a band and the members, may or may not develop a friendship. The Silver Jews is always like a friendship first, and the music is sort of an expression of the friendship. Just like talking, or hanging out together would be another. I like playing with other people. It's always been my project as much as Pavement is Steve's project, and I guess I'm kind of burnt on all the Pavement talk and stuff like that, and I'd like to do something on my own. I'm going to do another project with Will Oldham [of the Palace Brothers] that's going to be called the Silver Palace. So maybe just for now I'm going to play with other people, but it will always come back to the original line-up at the end.M:    When did the Silver Jews first get together?D:     We've been playing since the late '80's in college in Charlottesville [The University of Virginia]. The first time we started calling it Silver Jews was when we all moved up to New York together in 1989 right after college.M:    So how did you guys first meet?D:     Bob and I met in the hallway of a dormitory, and Steve and I met on a way to a concert. We both caught a ride with the same guy to go see the Cure.M:    How did you come up with the name Silver Jews?D:     Silver Apple, Silver Beetles - you know - we wanted to be a Silver band, and Silver Jews, we just liked the sound of it. Coincidentally, I happen to be Jewish, but I don't think that had anything to do with it. I can't even remember thinking of it when it came about, so it just goes to show how it appeared one day. I don't think there was any thought about it.M:    How did the process of creating Starlite Walker differ from your previous stuff?D:     Most obviously because it was recorded in a 24-track studio and The Arizona Record was recorded on a hand-held walkman, except for the last song which was recorded on four track. Number two, all the other stuff I wrote together with Steve, and this record I wrote by myself. Number three, the songs were written out beforehand, and were worked on more.M:    It sounds like on the new album you are singing more of the lead vocals and Steve is singing more of the background vocals, but sometimes it's hard to tell you guys apart.D:     Yeah, on this record Steve's singing more background vocals. On the other ones, some of the songs were 50/50, or 75/25, me/Steve. Some people have a hard time telling the differences, wich always makes me laugh, because Steve has a lot more versatility as a singer. But I think it just comes from... well, probably you and your friends talk alike or sound alike. That happens after hanging out with someone for many years."

  "title": "Such Nice Boys...",
  "body": "http://www.weeblackskelf.co.uk/cordsuit/img/photos/dcbsm2.jpgIt's a blustery fall afternoon in the Big Apple. Leaves are swirling across town, and it's a perfect day for warm socks and hot chocolate. But instead of staying inside and watching Court TV or the History Channel, David Berman, the man behind the Silver Jews, is standing alone outside a dog run in Central Park.\"I can't tell you how much I miss my dog, Jackson,\" he says. \"I come here so I can pet them all and spend a little time with the animals. And it seems to make the owners feel good, too, when you make a fuss over their dogs.\"Probably the most endearing character in indie rock, Berman is the kind of guy one would want to take to grandma's house. He is friendly and genuinely interested in everything around him. He seems to have an almost impish quality, a combination of youth and experience.\"People are very open to things when they are born, but we all unlearn that openness as we grow up. It's a shame, really. I've always been a fairly unafraid person,\" he says. \"I am affectionate and I like to show that to people I am close to.\"This \"new openness\" Berman addresses has gotten a fair amount of attention lately, with Palace's Will Oldham and the members of Guv'ner joining the club. But Berman finds talking about the subject to be counter-factual.\"I can't really describe it anymore, it is just something that is in me, in everyone, to be open and not lie or pretend. I can't deal with that fiction,\" he says. Untruths are certainly not a part of Berman's music. On its latest album, American Water, he takes the Silver Jews to a new level of maturity and depth. This is adult music with a twist - a metamorphosis of all things born and bred in America and beyond. The album is lyric-driven and emotion-charged at every junction. Songs like \"Random Rules\" and \"We Are Real\" punctuate the heartbreak with bits of everybody's reality.Berman's constant attempt to string a series of consequences together are apparent in every moment of his music. Each song is a story leaving the listener feeling like a voyeur.\"I don't have a single secret in my life. I tell everybody everything,\" he says. \"I can't not. If I don't tell someone, at least one person, the details, it's like it never happened. I have to divulge it to harden it.\"Berman's lyrics have a kind of seductiveness. There is always hope at the end of the sentence.There is no distance on American Water. Berman's image-filled music drags pieces of his real-life narrative along with every word.\"You need to heighten the experiences and make them into more than what they are. Not make up stuff, but put things in an order. Every moment or detail or phase or sentence has to modify another. That's when it becomes a story,\" he explains.Joining in this story is friend and Silver Jews bandmate Steven Malkmus, along with Tim Barnes, Michael Fellows, and Chris Stroffolino, has helped to craft Berman's into a dynamic final product. Although Malkmus' involvement in the archetypal neo-slacker outfit Pavement may have brought a lot of attention to The Silver Jews, he is quick to point out this band is not about him.\"This is David's project, and I am so happy to be part of it. It is fun and it's valid. He is doing something very worthwhile, and I think the world needs more of that,\" says Malkmus. \"It took a long time for David to get his confidence. But at this point, the Silver Jews have taken on more meaning and more intense than we ever expected.\"When The Silver Jews began, it was the ultimate in lo-fi. The band's first EP, The Arizona Record, was recorded in 1993 on a Walkman while the gang wandered around the house.\"The Walkman was kinda like taking notes. It froze the moment really well,\" he says.But since then, Berman has taken his music to the studio. It would seem like the thought of going into a full-scale studio would put the fear of technology into the hearts of these men, but Berman is indifferent to the change in venue.\"The first time I went into the studio, it was great. It doesn't stress me out because I don't pay any attention to the technical side. If you have too many options, it can be very difficult -- paralyzing, even. I just always remember a parable I once heard about a donkey who starved to death because he was given two perfect barrels of hay and he couldn't decide which one to eat from. That's what happens to a lot of bands. If you know you can do everything, you can't really do anything. Limits are the key.\" "

  "title": "Silver Jews Make Splash With American Water",
  "body": "Indie rock act's latest album is more upbeat and marks return of Pavement singer/guitarist Steve Malkmus. Article from Sonicnet.Staff Writer Chris Nelson reports:There are no lightning bolts for Silver Jews' singer David Berman; nothing to strike him creatively from out of the blue. There are no indie-rock muses calling with songs unwritten, he said, nor streaks of dumb luck where he stumbles across a series of good tunes. Rather, for this 31-year-old former Texan, songwriting is good old hard work.While some might describe his band's well-crafted, occasionally cryptic 12-song album American Water (Drag City) as inspired, Berman himself insisted recently, \"I don't believe in inspiration.\" \"It works for a while to feel like, 'I'm just visited by these songs,'\" he continued. \"You hear songwriters say that, more than any other type of artist. But I think that may be an explanation of why songwriters have the shortest span of doing good work of almost any other kind of artist. I'm really interested in gaining control of what I'm doing and trying to have control over what I'm doing.\"American Water, Silver Jews' recently released fourth album, marks the return of Pavement singer and guitarist Steve Malkmus to the band's rotating lineup. It also features the restoration of upbeat sentiments after 1996's downcast The Nature Bridge. Not that a writer as serious and purposeful as Berman has created an indie-rock party collection.\"Random Rules\" kicks at the edges of depression like a genuine country song. \"If you don't want me, I promise not to linger,\" Berman sings, characteristically just a bit off key. \"But before I go I have to ask you dear about the tan line on your ring finger.\"Still, on other tracks such as \"Blue Arrangements\" and \"People,\" the band - rounded out by Mike Fellows on bass, Tim Barnes on drums and Chris Stroffolino on piano - insinuates playful rhythms and word choices into Berman's songs.\"It's a lyrical record in the end,\" said Malkmus, 30, at the time of its recording. \"It's a record you sing along to. In that way, it's kind-of country. You expect maybe the next melody, but you don't know what [Berman is] going to say. There's a cleverness to [doing] that in a way that's not hacked or generic.\"Berman said the change in mood for American Water reflects, in part, his lack of a steady home base over the past year. Because he spent much of the time traveling or bunking with friends, he said, his songs from the period came out as less personal, less melancholy.This allows other people's energy to seep through into the piece, he said. The album's title mirrors Berman's offbeat cleverness.\"It came from a poster in a veterinarian's office,\" he explained. \"I was taking my dog to the vet, and there was a poster with different dog breeds on it, and one of them was 'American water spaniel.' Like anything that catches my eye or imagination, its function or meaning was incomplete. That interests me as something to build on. It seemed like two words without an attachment, and now they have a reference, which is the record. So if someone says to me, 'What is American water?', I'd say, 'It's this record.' If it was called \"American Water Spaniel,\" then I'd have to say, 'It's a dog.'\"Unfortunately for Silver Jews fans, the band won't be touring this fall, thanks to an ear injury Berman sustained during a street brawl in Spain while on a press junket for the album. While he recovers, he intends to finish editing \"Actual Air,\" a new volume of poetry to be published by Open City Press next March. At the same time, he'll probably continue his songwriting, an ever-evolving pursuit that's as much the passion of self-discovery as creativity.\"I want to write more songs without holes in them,\" Berman said. \"I tend to leave the holes in, and I still don't understand why I'm hesitant to fill in the complete narrative. I don't want to be obtuse or obscure; it's not that. But when you write a song -- as opposed to writing a story -- the music is doing a lot of the work that normally plot and characterization and setting would do. I'm sometimes afraid that if I tell the complete story in words, the music will function merely as a pedestal.\" "

  "title": "American Water Domino Press Release",
  "body": "When David Berman was in New York this past spring recording the new Silver Jews album, American Water, he could be found almost any night of the week talking emphatically about something he cqalled the 'New Openness\". Part self-help, part spiritual agenda, part cocktail party schtick, the new openness is a kind of deliberately audacious honesty that allows us to say exactly what we are feeling at any given moment. It shows up everywhere on American Water : \"It is Autumn and my camouflage is dying\", \"I feel insane when you get in my bed\", \"Is the problem that we can't see, or is it that the problem is beautiful to me?\"American Water is adult music, a grown man's music, and on every track it's haunting with the confidence and apprehension of someone who has passed out in shadows and woken up under a flourescent glare. Bucolic and beleaguered, the album stands up with and assuredness and weary charisma that is a rare commodity in music these days and chilling to be near. The trapdoors and back alleys of personality that give dimension to Berman's songs are by turns scary, reassuring, and eerily familiar. In 'Like like the the the Death' he sings, \"My life at home everyday / drinking coke in a kitchen with a dog who doesn't know his name / Oh right / it could have been anyone / grass, rabbits, grass, rabbits, grass.\"Even if it's an elaborate ruse, the New Openness cuts right to the quick - something that might be said of American Water and the Silver Jews in general (granted the cutting may be more of a hunting, and the quick no more than a blur of personal contingency). A thrust of Silver Jews has always been to stir up the garbage of recieved emotions that makes most pop music a landfill of cop-outs.Comfortable with neither the bland expressionism of indie rock nor the platitudes of country music, Berman throws himself into the huge and obscure divide that yawns out below the typically American struggle to reconcile the mythic with the everyday. It's not enough to say that the Silver Jews sing about the small-time lives of rotten suburbs or the mundanities of growing older with only culture-addled no-sense of your-self.What's important in the Silver Jews music is the vortex of consequences - psychic or otherwise - that takes its toll whenever we try to have a good look at ourselves. Neither good lives nor bad lives are easy, and it's something extraordinary just to see a mirror for what it is.Punctuated by Steve Malkmus' stoned guitar twang and occasional singing, Berman's baritone lyrics have a mid-thought seductiveness that is reminiscent of Dylan and Mayo Thompson, or John Phillips and Skip Pence - all od whom are experts at drawing in a audience with one hand and turning them back into the forest with the other. To his credit though, Berman seems to have had enough with wilful misdirection. A life of walking in circles will make one value steadfastness, if nothing else \"I'm gonna shine out in the wild kindness\" he sings on American Water's last, most poignant track \"and spurn the sin of giving in.\" How much longer must we inhabit this divine fork-in-the-road? Until we recognise the footprints trailing off behind us as our own. "

  "body": "= Interview: David Berman of the Silver Jews === Posted by Michael D. Ayers at 12:00 PM, April 14, 2008 ==\"My Morning Jacket—love the way it sounds. . . until you’re on the subway, and you can concentrate on what he’s saying, and all of a sudden, you’re like 'Oh my God, this guy had no idea what he was doing, and he was just hoping to get this stuff by without anyone really noticing.' And he’s done a wonderful job of it, because if you don’t pay attention, you don’t notice these terribly embarrassing things.\"There are some things you should know about David Berman, if you’ve never listened to Silver Jews. Or even if you have. He’s a romantic, while at the same time, hyperaware of his consciousness—it’s not enough to say “self-conscious,” because that connotes a degree of self-pity. It’s different than that: he speaks his mind in a direct, unapologetically blunt fashion, quite the opposite of his oft-cryptic approach to writing song lyrics.This June, the Silver Jews will release the excellent Lookout Mountain, Lookout Sea on Drag City—their sixth full-length in two decades. Before that, they’re going on a short tour with Israeli trash-rock trio Monotonix, an absurdly perfect pairing Berman describes as “such a wrong thing to do.” Also, Berman is a poet and artists with his drawings recently selected as a part of the Dave Eggers curated caption-art show Lots of Things Like This.\"A few days after Apexart had the opening reception, I had dinner with David and his wife Cassie, who now plays bass full time for the Silver Jews. I wanted to be a bit antagonistic, but was too smitten by their husband-wife glow.VV: I was asked to talk to you about a documentary you were involved in.David Berman: Mmmhmm. What was the documentary?Cassie Berman: The Silver Jews documentary?Yes.David: It only showed in three cities in America, in like one day.Cassie: No, it went to South by Southwest, and a traveling little circuit.David: Well, no one was blown away by it.What was the gist?Cassie: He hasn’t seen it.You haven’t seen it?David: A guy I knew, was going around with us in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and it’s me going totally off the cuff, to lots of different people, all day long. And obviously, when you do that, its not as circumspective as when you are emailing, or things you half-way believe, or are poorly explaining…I find that to be the worst kind of activity, to be seen in films. It’s like kissing babies footage; there were really sweet people that were really surprised that this band was in Israel, because of the tour there. The film is basically of these two shows, and it ends up on Wailing Wall- and apparently, I have an emotional experience where I was crying. And this one guy who wrote about it said to him, crying is porn, it’s like his porn.A reviewer wrote this?David: Yeah, he was saying that crying is the forbidden; it’s the worst thing you can see. Mick Jagger doesn’t want you to see him cry; it’s the last thing. Unless it’s an important time for where a man to cry; I mean, maybe you’d like to see Abraham Lincoln with one tear or something, but I guess I’m kind of a crier. So, I knew if I saw that movie I’d tell him to take it out. But I didn’t want to; that’s such a wrong thing to do. Kind of like having Monotonix open for you.When I find something that is the 180 degree wrong idea, then it’s right for us. Because no one else likes that, and that’s something I can be alone with. That’s why I take pleasure in talking about things, spitting out just about anything, the “opposite George theory” of life—because to change your opinion, to change your luck—that’s not working for me. It’s sort of like having a wife who you know loves certain things that you never want to do. That you know would love that if you just would do that thing—something you hate. Ice skating. Hiking, for me.Cassie: Camping.David: Right, right. But if you were to, its like contained positive energy that you’re not releasing into the world. So when you do those spontaneously, or what I call “throwing curve balls”—you’re making your wife happy, and you’re also breaking a pattern. It’s kind of like liberation of the slavery of the tyranny of never wanting to do anything. It’s sort of like that.I think in a Pitchfork interview, I did before Tanglewood Numbers came out—I did this long interview, and it was notorious because I explained how much money a person who sells 20,000 records will make. And people—it was shocking to them. It’s the last thing people will talk about, especially if you break it down. I think the latest way that I want to do that, with this album- the chords are all in the album. There are only sixteen chords on the whole album, and so, you always wonder why in the liner notes, bands don’t put their chords there? Its almost like bands are afraid to show how easy it may be. Why is that not often done? Most bands’ chords are only two or three; and people would cover their songs. There is no reason in the world, from a business standpoint—it's insane not to. If you put these things in there, you are encouraging young children to learn to play on them. And those are the people they go on to cover, maybe.So, from a mercenary point of view, it’s the thing to do. The reason I do it, is because that’s the sort of great twist of things. The only reason I can do it, is because I use so few chords. The reason Radiohead can’t do it, is because you can’t give something to someone, that they can’t absorb. They can’t give their music away for free; they can give their recordings away and tell them to name the price. But to give someone your music, you have to give them something they can play, and a method of playing. So this insert in there, it has the sixteen chords, and the tabs. All these chords are ones that use two or three fingers at the end of the neck.Cassie: We call that “Farmer’s Corner” in Nashville—at the end of the neck.David: Where all my songs get written. By providing these, literally—if a person was to be on a desert island, with a guitar and a CD, and never had played guitar before—or in your apartment, where your roommate has a guitar—in a couple of hours, you could be playing songs. To me, that’s like a whole weird life to it, when it comes out. I’m inviting people to play the songs, and I try to make the songs as coverable as possible, but with as little idiosyncratic—not as much self conscious, self-referential stuff…In what?David: In the lyrics…it’s so hard for someone to cover a song that has a joke, that is based on that person’s personality.Well, one second though, if you’re going to say that. I got some crib notes, that are about your lyrics on Lookout. And there are some obscure references. I definitely agree with you; if you’re not really listening to it—it does stand up as a whole, and you don’t need to “get it.” But at the same time, this material that you’re drawing on, is so random. Speeches that Roosevelt did to young boys clubs. That Roger Miller-ism, “country-restroom.” It’s a quick, quick reference…David: Yeah, that’s the thing. There is a lot of content, and within the content, there is a way of reading the record just as a history of me and Cassie. There is a way to read it, and just like the year 1913—it brings up a lot of stuff, in terms of what I am saying about this time, and comparing it to 1913, before the world changed forever. This album is kind of me speaking to people born after 1980, people that are younger than me. It’s me saying that “things are not going to be like this.” With Silver Jews music, you have to listen to it, and you have to make connections later down the line. Because you’re so used to making music that doesn’t have any meaning, that it’s really easy to listen to without that. And it should be able to do that, song by song. I try and make it narrative and pretty straight.Well the problem with someone like me, is that I listen to music while doing other things. Especially while writing, or even reading about other bands. Which is probably the worst thing you can do.David: I know what you mean.Read about why a band is good, or sucks. And that’s how I listened to Lookout the first several times. I did listen to it on my CD player, while I was doing household chores. And that’s a different type of experience. But when I was on the subway, and no one was around to bother me, and my eyes weren’t fixating on anything. That’s how for me, with everyone of your records, you have to get, and realize they are so accessible. And then there’s the words, in which you start talking about Swedish Fish—which I have to buy for my wife every week.David: So it builds a connection.Definitely with your tunes, it’s something you can’t be a background listener to. You’re not going to get it.David: It’s inferior background music.It totally is!David: My music has the ability to depend on that attention. Movies still demand that attention. You can’t watch a movie and do those kind of things. And a director is sure that these things will be examined, and compared to. In music, you’re pretty sure that these things won’t be paid attention to. Except to guys like you, who finally get alone with it.Can you imagine going into a movie, and reading a magazine, or watching another movie? It doesn’t make sense, in consuming another art form. Or like your thing the other day, I guess people could listen to tunes while they’re looking at your pictures.David: Well I started to foresee something in the late 90’s, when instrumental music started becoming really popular, that started saying something to me…Like who?Well, in general techno and the electronic movement that is less lyric oriented. That to me really became a part of the shopping culture that’s really come up. Because music like that really makes you the star, you’re in the forefront, and it’s the soundtrack to your life. That’s kind of the Night of the Roxbury guys. And that music means something else. And I think that is what music got to me. And that’s why the band, if they have the right style and the right form, then they are a lot closer to being finished. I think the background is the big issue now. When bands are doing lots of harmonies and reverb, I think it’s a drawing back from the foreground from having to say anything. The Flaming Lips sound was always about individuals, but they created a way out of putting mortal feeling into their songs, while seeming to still embrace the good. Which is all about the “ahhhhhhh.” It’s like My Morning Jacket—love the way it sounds, until you have the opposite experience. Until you’re on the subway, and you can concentrate on what he’s saying, and all of a sudden, you’re like 'Oh my God, this guy had no idea what he was doing, and he was just hoping to get this stuff by without anyone really noticing.'” And he’s done a wonderful job of it, because if you don’t pay attention, you don’t notice these terribly embarrassing things. If my music doesn’t get heard or concentrated on, then its below the standards of regular people. If you put on a Silver Jews record at a regular office, this sort of dislike that is expressed, is not that this is egghead music. That this is other music performed with a more rudimentary singer, with not as thrilling of hooks or something. But if you put it in another context, and treat it like something that is throwing its weight, and needs to be listened to, and more interpreted . . . I need people to raise their standards, so I can have a chance. If you don’t raise your standards, then I lose. Left alone with regular people and the mainstream, then I fail, in that Venn diagram.That’s a good bridge to this Apex gig that went down. Speaking of mainstream…it seemed like a very high art thing to be involved in. Is this a regular occurrence for you, down in Nashville? David: No. It was totally, out of the blue. I don’t know Dave Eggers, and he asked for one little drawing…I never volunteer myself, but I did say that I do this kind of stuff, this is my specialty. These rude little drawings. So I sent a bunch of them, and he put up those. These are my most inquisitive impulses; why should I hang my cartoons in shows with Mac from Superchunk and John Darnielle from The Mountain Goats in coffee shops….what I’m really saying, is if you can contextualize yourself—it's impossible usually. But I don’t belong to the art worlds, and I don’t belong to the music or poetry worlds either…It’s like I have this little cheat going on. I can do one thing in those three places that’s a bit good, but in all three of those places, I can’t do everything good. I’m a bad drawer, I’m not a good singer, and in poetry I have no training or form. So, it’s almost like I’m cheating…like a con man, who is presenting a little bit of one story…Yeah, but didn’t everyone say they loved it, the other night?David: NoNo?David: I don’t think people got a chance to look at them. It was too crowded…it was very tiny, and you couldn’t get back from the walls and get a look at them.Did you have to stand by it, and explain this is my….David: No…there wasn’t any other artists there, and I thought that was weird. And there was a line out the door, but no one would leave. I was glad that I was in that show, but it was poorly planned.Were there price tags on it, for sale?David: No…it was just a show. I just thought, well, hopefully this will jack up the value. For insurance, you have to declare a value. So, I said a thousand dollars.Per piece? David: Yeah. And they’re just pieces of 8 ½ by 11 pieces of paper. But I’m like, if I don’t call it a thousand, if I don’t say I’m a musician, and if I don’t say I’m a Jew, no one is going to say I’m a Jew. If I don’t name these prices and contextualize myself, if I keep letting the world do that for me, I’m going to keep meeting the wrong people and put in the wrong places and misunderstood. Because that’s what it is—you get tired, you make the record, and then say “take it over guys.” It’s a recipe for being misunderstood, for anybody, if you have stuff you’re trying to communicate.With this showing, and with the Jews output, it seems like there has been a lot of attention thrown your way.David: But I’m coming out more, so people are opposite maybe.Do you think there are more people hearing it, more people recognizing that it’s good?David: For me, and maybe you’ll be surprised at this—but I think that music fans who aren’t Silver Jews fans….no, I don’t feel that way. I feel like it's “He’s still here?” And “Is he qualified to do that?” and “What’s he trying to get away with?” I do feel some hostility from writers, because it’s easy for them to make that case—that it looks easy. Would you really be surprised if I told you that the consensus of people that hear Silver Jews records, end up despising Silver Jews? That’s how I go around thinking. I think more people have heard the Silver Jews and said “I despise that band” than have bought a Silver Jews record.I think its more of a I don’t know who they are, versus those that love. I’ve never heard of a hate. Maybe I’m just not talking to the right people.David: Google “I hate the Silver Jews.” I did that once, and there was a quote from Sufjan Stevens interview. He said “I hate bands that make fun of religion . . . I hate the Silver Jews and other bands that make fun of religion.” "

  "body": "A roundtable with Silver Jews, Pavement, Palace and Royal Trux by Gali Ohara== Jenny Mae, \"Hey Baby\" (Anyway) ==Will Oldham (Palace): If I walked in and heard it, I'd turn around and walk back out.Stephen Malkmus (Pavement, Silver Jews): It was just a pop song.WO: It was no fun.David Berman (Silver Jews): It was just a pop song, fine. Why aren't you allowed to work in a pop paradigm now, when it's fine for you turn on an AM radio and you have the 1910 Fruitgum Company.WO: When there's really quiet vocals and really loud guitars, it always seems annoying. It's just no fun at all.DB: I didn't like it, but I'm curious what there motives were. If they're into self glorification, then I have to castigate 'em.SM: They're trying to sell, make a big hit.WO: You can't judge music by the intention of music.DB: When you sing that way, you can't hear the words.WO: What's the deal with vocals as instrument but still using language?DB: There's no point. They might as well moan and wheeze.WO: Exactly. If they moaned and wheezed, it would be a lot better.DB: But then it would just be [better] because it's avant-garde.== Rocket from the Crypt featuring Holly Golightly, \"Eye on You\" (Interscope) ==DB: There was a male lead singer. I couldn't tell if he had two backup singers.WO: He had a guest vocalist.DB: Right, but she was lower in the mix.WO: She had a seperate part.DB: But she was quieter than him. Emotionally, what she was putting forth was she was backing him up.WO: I didn't think so.DB: He was being a revolutionary and he was out there preaching, and she was live Che Guevara's lover. They had sex. Obviously the way he was singing and the way he was behind her- definitely they fucked each other. Either they're sleeping together now, or when she got in the band they were sleeping together.SM: She was like, \"I'm just as bad as you.\" but she got screwed in the mix.WO: She was the highlight of the song.== Barry Adamson, \"Come Hell or High Water\" (Mute) ==SM: Tortoisehead.DB: The real question here: is he black? At first I thought he was white, like a Nick Cave guy, but he could be a black guy who is like Puffy.Jennifer Herrema (Royal Trux): Nah, man. This is depressing but that's about it.DB: What does that mean if music is depressing? If the guy's depressed, then it should make you feel better. How does it achieve that power over you? If it's really bad music, it should not touch you at all.WO: It's potentially depressing. The fact that we can stop it makes it not depressing.DB: From his voice do you think that he's a depressed person?JH: I wouldn't even venture to say.WO: He's most depressed right after playback.DB: It probably depends on how much sex he gets. If he has an active sex life, he's probably not depressed. If he doesn't have any sex life at all, he is.JG: Why do you say that?WO: He's, like, 320 pounds.DB: I bet that piano player has a good sex life. This is what Rollins should be doing- if Rollins went the Barry White route.== Page & Plant \"Most High\" (Atlantic) ==SM: This could be a Soundgarden remix. Oh, this is the new Led Zeppelin album. I've heard this on the radio. It's the single.WO: It starts just like \"Rid of Me.\"SM: He's going for that religious, trancendental, Indian thing.DB: It doesn't seem like he's saying to the women- like he used to with basically every syllable- \"Fuck me. I'm going to fuck you.\" He seems like he's being just as passionate and soulful, but I'm picking up some Middle Eastern influences. A little Zen, possibly a little Tao.SM: There's going to be a worl-music bit coming up now soon. It's a weird pipe.DB: Bagpipes, harmonium. I like that they're making this weird instrument the lead, because normally you wouldn't want it to play that long.SM: Snakecharmer. They're definately into reffering to their old work. They sort of stopped at In Through the Out Door and didn't try to make something different.JH: It could be Jane's Addiction.DB: The production of that first Jane's Addiction album reminds me of this.WO: It's Albini.SM: I think it sounds good, though.DB: It sounded a lot like \"Kashmir.\"== The Scene Is Now, \"Grenadine\" (from Object Lessons: Songs About Products) (Inconspicuous) ==JH: It's making me happy.DB: It's like childrens music but for adults, to make them feel young and childish.SM: I thought that was Frank Black.DB: He's doing a better job now singing. I've got to give it a thumbs-up.WO: Thumbs down hereSM: It gets points for weird time changes.DB: I don't know anything about that stuff.SM: The vocals kind of bothered me.== Girls Against Boys, \"Vogue Thing\" (DGC) ==SM: This is Girls Against Boys. I heard them on the radio too. It's kind of like Cop Shoot Cop.DB: That wasn't going anywhere. That reminded me of artificial breast implants: They looked good but they felt really bad.WO: As opposed to real breast implants?== The Hangovers, \"I Hate You\" (Kill Rock Stars) ==Db: This reminds me of that comedian Judy Tenuta- a Lilith tour Judy Tenuta.SM: I can't deal with her voice.WO: Is this Victoria WilliamsTony: It's Gina Birch (from the Raincoats) and her new band.DB: You know what offended me about that song? She doesn't know what makes people feel good, and the worst part is she doesn't give a damn about what makes people feel good. She was there to impress you with what she's doing.WO: Exactly. She grew up in a scene, and it's like a job.DB: I hate negative people- she was so negative. Ugh. The music was so gross and selfish and English.SM: I don't think she thought it was. I think she thought it was really happy. For where she came from, that was happy.== Bill Fox, \"Song for a Drunken Nightingale\" (Spinart) ==DB: Is this a four-track in the 90's in someone's room or a studio in the 60's?SM: It's probably Elliot Smith. It could be Dump. Is it Dump?WO: Veto, veto, veto. We're hearing song after song that's no fun to listen to. Music is a time art, and as we're progressing through time, we have to be achieving a climax, and we're not.SM: That's fine. I like that. That was like Jim Croce. That sounded good.== The Fleshtones, \"Don't Be a Dropout\" (from James Bond tribute Super Bad @ 65) (Zero Hour) ==DB: Sounds like the Clash.JH:Sounds like the Stones, man.DB: The Clash sounded like the Stones.SM: \"Taking Care of Business.\"JH: Is it Graham Parker?DB: Arto Lindsay?== Add N to X, \"Sound of Accelerating Concrete\" (Mute) ==DB: Shit. I feel like i'm inside of Tron. Anyone feel like killing themselves?SM: Another day at the Mercedes factory.DB: This is the sound of them banging out tire wells. They know how to push all the wrong buttons."

  "title": "Highway 61 Revisited / The Natural Bridge",
  "body": "This will appear in Melody Maker at some point, in the Rebellious Jukebox slot, but it will be in a much edited form.SP: Stephen Pastel \\DK: David KeenanAt the ICA, London, lying on the floor...5. Bob Dylan \"Highway 61 Revisited\" / Silver Jews \"The Natural Bridge\"SP: There's something about songs, such a great medium to express ideas within the limitations of the English language. People like Berman, there's just so much freshness in those words, it always sounds so new. I don't think Berman's like are that clever, in a way, they're beyond that. Silver Jews \"Natural Bridge\", there's probably not an equivalent record for me this year, maybe Smog's \"Red Apple Falls\", just a record I never get tired of and can play over and over, just enjoy. There's something pastoral and rural about the Silver Jews and sometimes I just want to really be a part of that, just open up to that gothic American tradition. I think they're a mythical, magic band.DK: The period of Dylan they make me think of is when he was up in Woodstock recording the Basement Tapes.SP: Yeah or \"Nashville Skyline\".DK: Getting back to the mythical America.SP:  It's an America that's got a kind of...that `post' idea of America that makes you just want to travel the land. Everything you ever felt through Kerouac.DK: The skiesSP: Y'know, just calling your album \"The Natural Bridge\"DK: It's difficult to talk about the Silver Jews in critical terms because, well, I know exactly what he means and what I feel about \"The Natural Bridge\" but I can't go any further towards elucidating it than that.SP:  Berman's writing is really great cause on one hand he's always got this kind of `Olde Worlde' kind of thing. You can imagine him as some front line reporter trying to document the American civil war and at the same time there's something really `hip' about it. He's mixing that up with almost hip-hop kids dealing with each other. I love that and Dylan's like that, he's so fucking, his language is so hip but timeless also. Probably my favourite Dylan record is \"Highway 61 Revisited\"; \"Queen Jane Approximately\" is my favourite Dylan song. He can mix up lines of genuine profundity with nonsense but keep a consistency of mood, it's direct and it's unfathomable, really highbrow but also kind of pop. Back to the idea that we're trying to run through this intellectual high art thing. People are digging it and getting it.DK: Dylan always said \"I'm not a poet\", he's a performer, a rock musician, a folk artist, not a `poet', y'know? What Dylan did was expand the parameters of a nascent artform and when people see that they want to claim him for high art rather than allow him to validate this whole bastard form.SP: When you think of the development of Rock `n' Roll, Dylan going electric is the equivalent of what the industrial revolution is to the history of England.DK: Just think what it must have been like to be a bright kid who loved rock music and then Dylan came along. What a fuckin' gift! It must have been so exciting.SP: I mean I like The Rolling Stones from around the same period when Dylan was `at his peak' but there's a 3-dimensional quality to him which the Stones don't have. You could look at a great album like \"Beggar's Banquet\" and know that the Stones would be bad in twenty years time. You could see that. Whereas when you look at something like \"Nashville Skyline\" you think there is probably hope that the new Dylan record could be really good -- in a way it's still surprising but in a way it isn't.DK: Dylan, like Mingus or Bill Well, is a person who is motivated primarily just by his individual instinct. Dylan never followed.SP: Coming back to our theme, it's this preparedness to be fashionable or unfashionable, there's something really sad about the Stones, they always want to look hip and with the kids and that's why you get preposterous things like Jagger with 16 year old girls in their videos looking really turned on by them. It's really pretty unlikely, y'know? It's dishonest.DK: No matter how difficult you might find it to understand or empathise with Dylan's massive Christian conversion, the thing about Dylan which I love, is for one guy to have such belief in the face of everything and that's all the way through his career, from playing electric at Newport in the face of people like Pete Seeger who saw it as this massive betrayal, then to go on to be the biggest counter-cultural figure and walk out and give these OTT pro-Christian rants to his fans. And Bob's Christianity wasn't particularly enlightened or benign, it was total \"you will all burn in Hell\". Total belief again. Everyone is saying, \"Bob, what the fuck are you doing?\" But for him that was that. Incredible. In the face of everything, I respect that so much. "

  "title": "Gaining on the Green Man: A Road Odyssey in Four Acts",
  "body": "''29 September 2006''In an epic cross-hemisphere trek, writer Ben Oswest treads the long road between Cape Town and Wales to consummate a 13-year, 20,000-mile long-distance love affair with the Silver Jews.== I. Wintering in Wales: A Love Story ==The weather followed us into the Northern Hemisphere. As we careened around the back roads of Abergavenny and Merthyr Tydfil, the joy of the previous night still running at high temperatures in our brains and the drossy hills of the Brecon Beacons national park crowding the road, I had to switch our little Ford's wipers from \"interval\" to \"high\" and squint to catch the oncoming markers. It was the umpteenth time we'd faced such trouble in our journey to the heart of the British summer. Granted, these Welsh showers were nothing like the downpours we left behind in Cape Town - which had brought destructive flooding to the coast and snowdrifts deep enough to shut the mountain passes - but still, we were wearing scarves, there were two pairs of mud-caked Wellies in the boot, the heat was on, and it was August.My companion fiddled with the radio before deciding that nothing could compare with the sweet music that had kept us sleepless until the diminutive o'clocks of the previous evening; thus, Radio 1 and BBC Cymru were soon silenced. We rode on through towns with names like \"Bwlch.\" allowing ourselves to feel like conquering heroes.A great deal of planning had come to fruition. Against what had seemed like dizzyingly mounting odds, we had conquered the danger of missed connections across several flights (none!); the onset of the common cold (toughed out on the streets of London!); potential brushes with the Law (none! - despite cameras and patrol vehicles everywhere we ventured); and near collisions with other motorists' cars on countless confounded roundabouts (none! - by mere whiskers). We made it against the exceptionally unlikely impediment of a foiled terrorist plot, which had gummed up the skies over the Atlantic since our arrival. We had prevailed against a run-in with a seemingly considerate but phantom-like and ultimately perfidious PR gatekeeper. Last, we had made it against the weather, which pissed on us all the way from South Africa to the county of Powys.We had done it. We had consummated our 13-year, 20,000-mile long-distance love affair with the Silver Jews. We had seen them play live, at the 2006 Green Man Festival in Wales. Somebody pinch us.Our little Ford was passing through novel landscapes, but we were firmly rooted in the recent past, and somewhere along the road the mood turned philosophical. It was over - the Jews were gone. As the fire died to embers, my companion wistfully uttered one of the fundamental truths of indie rock, which she is wont to articulate from time to time. \"It sucks,\" she said, \"to share your band with other people.\"== II. Green Man, White Music ==At the Green Man Festival, you have to share your band with six or seven thousand people. This wasn't always the case: it used to be fewer. When the festival started four years ago, it catered to just 500 or so folk-music die-hards who gathered to bob heads in front of an unquestionably credible lineup. But, the fans multiplied, more than doubling every year. Eventually, the Green Man had to find a new Petri dish. A bigger home meant bigger and more diverse acts. Now the gig flirts with commercial respectability, and its identity is a slightly strained composite - the salt of the Earth covered with wholesome indie clover.Identity often has little to do with reputation, however, and the Green Man is still widely regarded as a hippy folk fest. This, mind you, is a blessing. In British English, if the word \"festival\" hasn't already made the rank of verb, it should be promoted as a matter of priority. Festivals are a way of life on the sodden island. One doesn't go to a festival; one ''festivals''. To festival is to voluntarily experience the Social Contract - that tenuous thing - under deeply Malthusian conditions. It is to join with a legion of others in the act of tramping a good green field into a gigantic mud wallow; and it is to risk having your face pushed into said wallow by any one of several flavors of drunk, roving, medicated yobs and lads. To festival is to wait - for music, with achingly long stretches between sets. To festival is to queue - for food, for water, for beer, for bowel relief. To festival is to find your way to your tent, amidst thousands of wrong ones, in pitch dark, with double vision, burst eardrums and an urge to vomit. Ultimately, to festival is to be reduced - as you don yet another layer of protective clothing against the elements and mud - to  human sheep. The lower you go, the higher the music can lift you.So, at the Green Man we festivaled for three full days and nights. But, then, perhaps we didn't truly ''festival''. Because of its New Age-y reputation - a \"green man\" is a pagan symbol, a wild, bushy, face-in-the-forest that approximates a Celtic gargoyle - the barbarians kept away, and the whole affair was actually semi-civilized. Parents let strangers tickle their children. The longest I queued for food was a half hour. The wallow in front of the main stage was hardly big enough for an elephant and a bull rhinoceros to share. In short, decency reigned.It helped that the barbarians had another outlet for their festivaling in the simultaneously-run V Fest several hundred miles away - it had bigger acts (Morrissey!), and attracted 60,000. (That's nothing: try Reading at 80,000, or the inconceivable Glastonbury at 150,000.) It also helped that the Green Man's £98 ticket and remote location in the Brecon Beacons national park system - easy to reach by private car, but a bitch to slog to on the buses - kept the audience safely bourgeois. What we had here, then, was a boutique festival. I reiterate: a blessing.The music suited the event to a 'T'. An esteemed South African writer once suggested that, when the conventions of Western fiction are adopted by those who write in non-Western locales, like Africa, then the result can be called \"white writing\", no matter the color of the author. I hereby extend this theory to music. What the Green Man offered its white audience were white tunes, almost without exception - despite a few variations in skin tone on stage. This is not to start an argument about the roots of folk (in Wales? try the Silures) or to cast aspersions on the lineage of indie rock (though it's clear that at some stage punk and krautrock overcame their differences). It's merely to record, having lived among whites in South Africa, and been subjected to a teeth-grindingly mediocre cognate of \"white writing\" in their rock (a few Afrikaners here excepted), how satisfying it was to recognize afresh, and experience live, the real thing at last.== III. The Star of David Berman: Intellectualized ==Some people, like me, mark the passage of time not with a calendar, but through Silver Jews albums. There have been six, between 1993 and 2005, with one release approximately every two years. The maestro at the center of this oeuvre is David Berman, a man who also has a book of poetry to his name (''Actual Air'').The poetry in Berman's band is evident in its very album titles. Scan: ''The Arizona Record'' (1993 - iambs) pairs off with ''Tanglewood Numbers'' (2005 - trochees) at the outer ends of the discography. Move in a ring, and ''Starlite Walker'' (1994 - trochee) matches up with ''Bright Flight'' (2001 - spondee!). Last, at the core, ''The Natural Bridge'' (1996 - iambs) meets ''American Water'' (1998 - iambs again). Isn't that instructive? And fun.While the band used to be mistaken for a Pavement derivative because of Berman's friendship with Steve Malkmus (who appears on several Jews albums), their approach to songwriting couldn't be more stark. With the Jews, you find achingly careful craft in the writing - in contrast to the classic, calculated-but-louche, irresponsible Pavement lyric. And the Jews' music can sound almost watery next to Pavement's sheer, hard razzle-dazzle amperage.  Performance is about confidence, and it's clear from his songs that Berman is loath to release a single chord before he's satisfied that the words are laid down perfectly. The tracks simply come second. Even when he's irresponsible (''My mother named me after a king / I'm gonna bury my name in you...'') his use of language is too serious to seem pure fun.== IV. The Star of David Berman: Observed ==Before their set at Green Man, guitarist William Tylor, who also plays for (rock band? commune?) Lambchop, expressed relief that the Jews weren't the evening's headliner. It was true: a chap called Juan Gonzalez was to close Saturday on the main stage. Tylor's relief derived from concern over the misfortune of the band's regular drummer, who was lying flat on his back, in the Abergavenny hospital, victim of a mysterious stomach ailment. Thus, the Jews' musical cohesiveness was under threat. Well not really. Their sound man was a certain Steve West, former tickler of skins for Pavement and he had offered to step into the breach. When I moseyed backstage to deliver my transcontinental \"hello,\" he was deep in concentration, listening to a Jews CD and tapping out the beats.Several months ago, Tylor's anxiety might have been put down to a lack of confidence in his front man's live-gig fitness. Until recently, Berman had almost never played live and was known to suffer paralyzing bouts of stage fright. As I chatted with Tylor and keyboardist Tony Crow, I kept glancing around, expecting a perfunctory puke to splash into the wet grass around the tent.The festival's PR liaison, in denying me an interview with the band some hours earlier, had fobbed me off with the excuse of Berman's nerves: \"He gets into a state before a show, he vomits; it's not pretty; it would be bad for you to be around.\" Now, it is a PR liaison's job to be disingenuous - just as it is a writer's job to step on his head if necessary to clutch the prize - but this was doing Berman a disservice. After tours in the US, Israel, and now Wales (the Jews played Cardiff the month before), Berman appeared an old hand; he seemed as relaxed backstage as he would be in a bar. If anything, it was back-up guitarist and vocalist Cassie Berman - part femme fatale, part fussy wife - who betrayed a bit of stress. Or perhaps she's just a natural-born sheepdog, particularly adept at herding everyone to their instruments.The biggest disservice done to Berman and Co. at Green Man, though - as backwardly intimated by Taylor - was letting another act follow the band. The King of Indie Rock, Stephen Malkmus, is dead, and David Berman is Lord and Protector of our beloved indie sound. His low, coaxing voice, his music's Southern jangle, the humanity of his songs - it all adds up to a kind of ''Pax Bermana'' on the indie scene. Under his reign, irony, if not altogether banished, is certainly out of favor. Genuine feelings may humbly approach and be absolved of self-consciousness. The Jews were the conquering kings of Green Man, and Royalty should come out last, after the plebes have finished making their porridge. Their set was 45 minutes long - as were all the sets at the Green Man - barely enough time to get to know them. They played the first song from each of their albums, a few more from ''Tanglewood Numbers'', and a couple from the back catalogue. Berman's courtliness shone through: he dedicated the haunting, melancholy \"Trains Across the Sea\" to my companion, who had written to him about it 12 years ago. This is a king who knows how to reward loyalty. Apparently, he has been singling out the faithful at many of his gigs, acknowledging their dedication and long-suffering wait for a live show. It's a good policy, one that affects delirious happiness.I was standing toward the back of the stage taking snaps and, during \"Punks in the Beerlight\", crept near the front for a quick peek at the audience. It seemed that thousands of Brits had memorized the Jews' songs, for they were all singing along. (Berman later said that if he's out of practice with a number, and forgets a lyric on stage, all he has to do is lip read.) The band was solid, the music was great - did it seem as if Cassie was a tad out of sorts? she might have been having an off night - and all too soon it was time for a victory beer.After the set, I caught Berman for a moment or two in the tent behind the main stage, where the bottles of Dorothy Goodbody's were kept. (Best bitter I drank in Wales.) The first thing I pointed out was that, with the approach of a two-year gap, it's almost that time again. Was he on track with album number seven? Happily, he confirmed that we can expect some news next May. We talked about how tough it is to make one's way as an artist: \"Everyone will tell you it's a waste of time\" he said. \"I was 31 when my father finally got the idea.\" Berman's advice to young people who are being guided toward grad school and desk jobs against their will? He spelled it out slowly: \"Don't give in to the pressure... because... you'll go crazy.\" Hear, hear. I pressed him to confirm that he had made up (coined?) the phrase \"soi disantra\" - he was urgently seeking a rhyme for \"they don't want ta\", wasn't he? - and then released him back to his band.But the night was not over. I ran through the muck to the stone wall that separated the greater backstage area from the common festivalers, met my companion at a pre-arranged spot, and, in literal Jane-Austen's-Captain-Wentworth fashion, \"jumped her down\" to my side (without any disastrous consequences).We rejoined the Jews, took photos all 'round, and eventually fell into conversation with guitarist Peyton Pinkerton (who also has his own band, New Radiant Storm King). The merits of Azita and the Fiery Furnaces were debated (Azita is listed in the credits of ''Tanglewood Numbers'', but apparently there was no room for her contribution in the final cut). Parts of America's socialist history were explored (Pinkerton is a Pinkerton - that is, he's from the family whose name was notorious among American unionizers in the early 1900s). A few Brythonic pronunciations were attempted (Pinkerton's taking a course in Welsh) and a final Dorothy Goodbody's was downed. And thus we concluded the somewhat incongruous, one-off gig in fit and proper style: Band and groupies meeting, boozing, and parting at the halfway point between Nashville and Cape Town.''Ben Oswest is author of ''The New Suffolk Hymnbook'', a novel, and his less-literary ramblings can be found at [http://boswestblog.com boswestblog.com]''"

The band, often mislabeled as a Pavement side project, actually coalesced before Pavement, though the two backstories share a history of caustic revelation.David Berman, guitarist-vocalist Stephen Malkmus, and drummer Bob Nastanovich formed the Silver Jews in 1989 while students at the University of Virginia. After graduation, they took the budding project with them to New York. Their music thrived in that city's frenetic air. The band's roster has changed continuously, but Berman, a heartbreaking writer and constant innovator, has always been at the helm. It's his project, his voice.Berman will be turning 40 in January. Four awe-inspiring full-lengths, a host of smaller projects, and a well-received poetry book (1999's ''Actual Air'') have placed him firmly in the cultural spotlight, often against his will. Berman is a recluse in some ways, a natural wordsmith — and instantly demanding performer — in others. He's given the Bay Area numerous poetry readings but never a rock show.Until now. Berman has been through some tough, emotionally trying shit lately, but he's back, with the eloquent deadpan that has made him the envy of songwriters, indie philosophes, and music junkies everywhere. Longtime fans may call this unprecedented tour a resurrection, but Berman laughs it off. \"I'd always planned to be a middle-aged performer,\" he jokes via an e-mail interview. \"This year has just been the run-up to the start of my contract with the Missouri River Blues Barge's Menthol Topaz Casino.\"Waiting for a new Silver Jews album is like waiting for John Darnielle of the Mountain Goats to take the stage: everyone is ready to be shattered and jubilant, lyric by lyric, tune by tune. On 2005's ''Tanglewood Numbers'', the first Silver Jews effort since 2001's ''Tennessee'' (both Drag City), Berman's voice sounds deeper than ever, as if it might break at any moment and never come back.The ''Tanglewood'' crew is rather big — 13 folks including Malkmus and Will Oldham — but that's just how they do it in Nashville, where the record was recorded and mixed. Other Nashville-ized albums by the likes of Cat Power and Oldham these past years have taken some getting used to. ''Tanglewood'' hits the heart instantly.Berman's vocal duos and duals with his wife, Cassie, who plays a variety of old-timey instruments on ''Tanglewood'', are organic and intensely personal. \"Humans have been failing Human Relationships 101 for half a million semesters straight now,\" writes Berman. The ability to perform back-and-forth vocal lines is \"one of the many things you can do more easily under a band name than as a solo artist,\" he notes. \"Different souls are in the music.\"On \"I'm Getting Back into Getting Back into You,\" the Jews sound trapped in a psychedelic small-town roller-skating rink, needing to raise their voices to be saved. But maybe we're all trapped. \"I've been working in an airport bar/ It's like Christmas in a submarine,\" Berman croons. An ominous \"om\" sneaks in at the end of the tune.Since their first recordings, made on answering machines and Walkmans, Berman and the Jews have been proving that our main roads are really back roads and vice versa. He writes of those early days: \"Getting the tape back after a good performance was hell — first the breaking and entering ...\" Americana, broadly defined, is sustained by such neighborhood trickery. When Lucinda Williams revisits childhood gravel roads or Darnielle sings about hearing the screams of football season, particularly American landscapes reveal what we had always thought were private obsessions. Such artists gain a universal appeal by taking local scenes and spraying themselves all over them. It's sound graffiti and it feels so good.Berman's current plan is deceptively simple: \"To keep making these different versions of the master Silver Jews album in the sky.\" On ''Tanglewood'', \"How Can I Love You If You Won't Lie Down?\" rocks hard but also highlights Berman's tragicomedy: \"Time is a game only children play well/ How can I love you if you won't lie down?\"The Mezzanine performance will feature Peyton Pinkerton and William Tyler on guitars — Pinkerton played on 1996's ''The Natural Bridge'', Tyler on 2001's ''Bright Flight'' (both Drag City) — Brian Kotzur on drums, Tony Crow on keyboards, and Cassie Berman on bass. Even the lineup gets Berman going. \"Peyton is a descendant of William Henry Harrison.... I'm convinced that many of our country's best electric guitarists are the far-flung descendants of mediocre 19th-century American presidents.\""

  "title": "Clip-On Tie: The Diary of a New York Art Museum Security Guard",
  "body": "by David Berman, published in Baffler #6:\"If there's ever a problem, I film it and it's no longer a problem. It's a film\":- Andy Warhol It would be a tragedy to spend your whole life desperately wanting to be something that you already were, all along. On Fridays the guards are given ten minutes to take their paychecks to the bank. The beautiful tellers have become arrogant from handling money all day. If they have time, they flirt with the big accounts. European tourists move about the museum half-interested, exactly fifty percent interested. Do they ever spill a drink or piss on their shoes? Sometimes, when a beautiful Italian girl wanders into an empty gallery I fantasize about walking over and kissing her on the neck. When she turned around and saw that I was a guard, I would straighten up and whisper \"no kissing allowed.\" The classicist's theme is the recovery of the subjective mind, the healing of the subjective mind. Well, our courts are clogged with these minds. The nineteen year old Cusies are the only twins on the guard force. The girls insist that their spooked grandmother tried to murder them twice during their infancy. First, she gave them diet gum in an attempt to dehydrate them. Second, she sent them new blankets in the mail-the blankets had been soaked in insecticide. Christ's message twisted: Only love your enemies. If the fable of \"The grasshopper and the ants\" was amended so that the world ended before the turn of winter, then the grasshopper would have been wiser and the moral would have vindicated him. In a story, the location of the ending is very deliberate. I've been photographing the imprints that deck chairs leave on the back of people's legs. A lady comes into the museum: \"I am a woman on TV. You have never had a TV. . . now get off my show!\" It only took a few minutes of this kind of talk to make me feel like the intruder. \"He\" was a sensitive reader, almost too delicate to withstand the commands and admonitions of punctuation. Two drunks outside the Greenpoint subway: \"You better leave an hour early to get there on time.\" They are lying, they never go anywhere, I thought to myself. For whose benefit would they be acting? Why am I so suspicious? John Baldessari burned all his pre-1967 paintings. \"I think that's odd behaviour but I would like to get in touch with him anyway, to see about using the ashes as makeup for this play I'm writing about British coal miners.\" After guarding masterpieces for weeks, it feels good to stand in my dentist's office before this cheap painting of a ship. If the world was a bit smaller, just three neighborhoods smaller, maybe things would work out. I've heard that there's a scarcity of luxury. In the movie theatres each person has to share an armrest with a stranger. What Duchamp did with the urinal no longer surprises me, what surprises me is the idea that they had urinals back then. I am waiting for the bus when I smell something burning. I turn to the man standing next to me and ask if he smells it too. In preparing to speak he lets a cloud of condensed breath out into the freezing air. For a half second my mind plays a trick on me. \"Oh no, he's burning,\" I think. No one gets hungry at the sight of a lush cornfield or a herd of cattle. It's enough to tell you that we're full of education, not awareness. The painter eyes his subject. It's a single piece of fruit, yellow and shaped like a lightbulb, split open to show the cavity where the pit would normally be, if the pit were not swirling around inside the painter's mouth."

  "title": "The Summer Before The Night Ecstasy Became Illegal In The State Of Texas",
  "body": "by David Berman, taken from a feature in Feed Mag.MY FRIEND KYLE always had a lot of money and could get me into the expensive kind of trouble without the trouble sticking. He didn't mind paying for me if it meant raising hell with loyal company. We were seventeen. You only needed one reason to be friends at that age. I figured we had at least three. So we broke the law every day in every way and laughed our asses off at the fucking stupid world. In late April we began to hear rumors about a new drug in the Metroplex. It was in the gay bars. Kids at the Arts Magnet were getting it. Certain people at certain parties had it and it was magical. They called it X. It was supposed to make you unaccountably happy and tolerant of everyone from headbangers to rich fucks. Even \"douchebags.\" Psychiatrists had been using it in therapy for years, we were told. It was legal and local product (it was still special to Texas at that time). It would make you love and accept anyone. Even yourself. This was a complicated promise for the teenager roiling with hate and confusion. I hardly believed it. But one night Kyle pulled out some foil holding four tablets, we each swallowed two, and went to a party where a lot of people were going to be doing it. Coming around the corner of that house, I'll never forget the scene. Every high-school rule was being broken before me. The lions were chatting up the lambs. I saw sworn enemies talking like longtime companions; a prickly society bitch on her knees sifting white garden pebbles through her hands with happy eyes; a brutal wrestler from my school with his arms wrapped around the trunk of a pecan tree, saying his first words to me ever, \"Hi David,\" sweetly, as I walked by. I rolled my jeans up to my knees and sat at the edge of the pool. Maybe for the first time I felt like no one was going to try to push me in. The stereo was playing \"Blues for Allah\" instead of the customary \"Eliminator.\" Nearby, two linebackers were confessing how much they depended on each other \"on and off the field.\" I felt myself giving in to all the kindness, not caring if it was a lie or not. By the time a hot Fort Worth Jewess sprang into in my lap and began running her fingers through my hair, I was sold. At sunrise, I came in through the sliding glass. I woke my father and his new bride, apologized for staying out all night, and pulled a chair up beside the bed. I continued to sit there and smile down on them. I said, \"I just want you to know how much I love you, Dad.\" Incredibly, he did not kick my ass. That morning was never mentioned again. AS I SAID BEFORE, ecstasy was still legal and as such carried virtually no stigma. Kyle's uncle kept a jar of tablets on his desk at his car dealership. Law-abiding adults were taking them at North Dallas cocktail parties. They were even sold behind the bars like cigarettes and openly hawked on street corners downtown. That summer, I crushed two sports cars with my homely Buick, received six speeding tickets (three in one day), two tickets for public urination, impregnated a Collin County judge's daughter, and had a bottle of MD 20/20 broken over my head. Approximately none of it registered with me. A very real fault of the drug. I'm going to skip the scenes of me chasing daisies and singing to stray dogs from still bulldozer cabs. I was exercising horses that summer for cash, and X hangovers were A-OK for barreling over the dull scrubland. Sometime in August, the lawmakers in Austin finally got around to outlawing ecstasy. What a gift for the dealers! The price of ecstasy immediately quadrupled and the production costs plummeted as the manufacturers began cutting the pills with all manner of horrible stuff. The night the law went through, I went to a concert at the Bronco Bowl and snagged two of the newly illegal pills for a dear price. I had never seen them in capsules and had no idea it was a sign they were crushing the old \"legal\" pills and mixing them with laxative, mannitol, low-grade speed, whatever. Once inside, I spent a half hour wiggling my way to the front of the floor. Unfortunately, when I got there I had a big problem. Not only were the drugs not kicking in, they were causing me to have to shit real bad. Michael Stipe was singing \"Moon River\" (hey!) a cappella and I knew I was going to blow if I didn't part this shoulder-to-shoulder crowd and make it to the restroom. The audience was frozen in place and dead silent as I plowed through, \"Excuse me, excuse me, emergency here, please, please\" ( I think I even yelled \"gangway,\" such was my ambition to get through), completely stepping on the vocalist's Ethel Merman star turn and nearly getting shhhhhed to death. I passed the rest of the concert in a nasty stall gritting my teeth, sweating and coming to terms with what was clearly the symbolic end of a spaced-out summer. Fifteen years on, I can honestly say I'm glad it was outlawed. After three months of its use I had lost all discretion and was prepared to trust just about anyone. Worse yet, it was turning me into a joiner. That's not who I am. Anyway, ecstasy was not to find its true customer base until years later, when the strangely passive kids who grew up in the child protectorate of the U.S. eighties and nineties came of age, craving depersonalization. Apparently it helps them dance. They're a very attractive lot. Have you seen them dance? David Berman lives in Nashville. His first book, Actual Air, came out last year via Open City Press."

  "title": "An e-conversation with David Berman",
  "body": "From http://www.theredalert.com/features/silverjews.htmSilver Jews leader David Berman is an iconoclast in the indie-rock world:  a well-regarded poet, an ardent football fan, and a troubadour who chooses not to travel.  Although he's been leading various incarnations of Silver Jews since 1989, his recorded output has been sporadic and the \"Silver Jews live show\" is an endangered species.  Fans have a much better chance of seeing him pop into a college bookstore for a poetry reading than into the local watering hole for a set of old chestnuts.  For the soon-forthcoming  Tanglewood Numbers, Berman rounded up a roster of enigmatic friends that would make any self-respecting hipster's jaw drop.  Their appearances range from the subtle (Will Oldham) to the obvious (Stephen Malkmus, who was a Silver Jew himself prior to his defection to the West Coast, where he started Pavement).  At the center of the album, Berman is reliably captivating, leading the \"Tanglewood Numbers Band\" through some of the merriest, most rockin' emotional dust-ups of his career.''“Sometimes A Pony Gets Depressed” reminded me of that clip that was circulating recently of the chimpanzee who’d become addicted to cigarettes.  Was there any concrete inspiration for that title?''I think it was incited by a book called “Helping Hooves” I ran across last year, about miniature guidehorses for the blind.  Sample sentence:  “Individuals who fear dogs are often more comfortable working with a tiny horse.”These horses are adorable, but inside they are like Brother Theodore.  They live to be fifty years old.  That’s about the length of a good marriage.  Unlike dogs (and unlike wives) horses don’t need human affection.  They can live outside when they’re off duty so they don’t fuck your house up when you’re not looking, which is all the time when you’re blind.So I had that on my mind when I saw an old picture I hadn’t seen in years.  It hung beside the basement door when I was a boy.  It was called “Forgotten.”  It was a sad scene.  A horse behind a fence in a pasture as a terrible snowstorm comes down on the field.  Far off you can see the farmhouse and the warmth conveyed by the windows. Now I started seeing the world through the eyes of a miniature pony…The humans have absconded.  With all their problems left behind.  The other animals don’t give a flying fuck.  A good night’s rest is out of the question.  I had to get out of that pony’s head!  Once I emerged and could truly “hear” the pony for the first time, I realized he sounded like an elderly Jewish man kvetching, which is all the time when you’re an elderly Jewish man.''In your recent Pitchfork interview, you said that you don’t play songs at readings because you weren’t born to be the center of attention.  Having gone through a university creative writing program, though, it’s been my experience that typical readings have a much more focused “center of attention” than typical music gigs.  What makes it easier, then, for you to get up and read than get up and play?''One of the first things I knew about myself was that I was not an exhibitionist.  There are shades of “acting” to all live music performances.  I can’t act.  Or at least not without a script.  For readings, of course, you have a script.  You don’t even have to memorize it.''Typical touring songwriters have ongoing relationships with their songs, often quite possibly for a longer duration of time than they’d like.  Because you’re not playing 200 shows a year, do you think that you are more detached from your back catalog than those peers? ''This is definitely the case.  I am a stranger to most of the songs I’ve written; there’s never an occasion when I need to play them.  Lately I have dug up some of the songs as I have saved them written down.  It’s like eating fried shrimp.  Strangely pleasurable.''Does it look like you’re going to wind up on the road for a bit once Tanglewood sees its release?  If so, how much of that is pragmatic and how much is that the album lends itself better to a full-band type touring experience?''It’s just like a lateral career move.  It’s not the same job.  There are tradeoffs.  Less privacy.  More…what…affirmation.  More financial solvency.  More chances to do some kind of help for people outside my immediate call list.''In the aforementioned writing program, there were two competing methodological camps:  1) A writer must write constantly and on a disciplined schedule and 2) Take inspiration and run with it when it comes, but don’t sit around trying to force it.  Which have you found to be truer to your processes as a poet and songwriter?''#2 most of the time.  But most of what I’ve written in my life has come in periods of three months to a year where I live like method #1.''Were all of the members of the Tanglewood Numbers Band old friends, or were there some newer faces in the mix?''95% of it was old friends.  You don’t have to worry that your session players don’t get your “vision” that way.  One new guy was Pete Cummings.  He’s Brian Kotzur’s (the drummer) uncle.  When he was 14 and 15 he played guitar in Elvis’s little pocket band.  He had a little band that was there for after the show, to unwind – who knows, Elvis might want to sing something.  Or just listen to a teen rock quartet.''How much reworking would you do once they came in with their written parts?''The core band wrote their own parts during the four practice sessions we had in my basement.  For overdubs, I had people play several to be sifted through later.  I was concentrating on getting my friends in the right mood the whole time.  Knowing the people well made that easier, too.  Some I knew would do better without me there.  And that’s where I got the idea to have them do a couple different things for me to check out later.  I think these are brilliant people, right, so to me this method works to produce an “embarrassment of riches,” as they say.  And it helps if you have a great mix engineer from there.''Steve Malkmus said in one recent interview that, even though he’s again played his part on this album, he had no idea of what the album was going to sound like.  Is that true for most of the collaborators?  It seems like Malkmus leaves a little more of a stamp on the final product than he might give himself credit for.''I think he means that after he left is when I brought in the outer band and changed engineers and even wrote a lot of the lyrics.  I didn’t finish until June.  He was there for the 12 most important days.  The first 12.  And he leaves a big stamp, yes he does.''Has writing music remained a constant, throughout everything?  Has listening?''No, I have only written music in certain years.  After The Natural Bridge, which was a rough experience to record, I couldn’t listen to music.  I could only listen to Urge Overkill’s Exit the Dragon because it seemed to close to not being music at all.  They were nearing TV pilot status.''I’ve been told several times that it’s “nitpicky” to assail an album because of its lyrics, yet no one has ever said the same thing about, say, overproduction or derivative guitar work.  Why are words such a second-class citizen in the music world?''I think there is a certain “keep the drummer down on the farm” attitude among a lot of music critics.  They like to perceive rock bands as “noble savages” they hold above the workaday pedestrian world.  The Stooges, The Ramones, Guns N’ Roses.  This is why other humanitarian critics embrace stuff like Whitehouse or violent rap music.It’s the same old story, though, of the well-to-do bewitched by “working class” authenticity.  These are the kinds of bands critics are most themselves while describing.  Bands like these are too hard, too real, too unselfconscious to explain themselves.  They need critics to do it for them.''How did you seek out music in Dallas in the early 80s?''There were a couple sources.  There was VVV record store on Cedar Springs.  The owner later became MC 900 Ft Jesus.  There was KNON community radio.  And on Sunday nights a radio show with George Gimarc playing strange things from England.  Bauhaus, Jesus and Mary Chain.  And the other “new waves” at your high school.''I guess the natural follow to that is…how do you seek out new music now?  Or do you?''I listen to maybe four CDs a week.''I tend to do a lot of digging during interview prep, but this is only the second time that I’ve found explicit references to football in past interviews.  I’ve talked to friends before who have had similar experiences of being treated like enjoying sports is a dirty little secret in the world of actors and writers and musicians.  “Oh, you’re into football?”  Have you noticed a similar phenomenon, where those high school lines between “jocks” and the “artsy” kids stay drawn?''It’s true.  It’s a complete reversal of high school when the jocks had the cultural authority.''Pacman had a pretty rough preseason.  Are you feeling that he can still be a boom, or is your gut saying “bust?”''He is the first Titan since 1998 that has generated general animus in the city.  Of course, he can change everybody’s minds by becoming a star.  I think Maurice Clarett might no longer have that option.  The jig seems up for him.''What’s your most frequent armchair quarterback complaint about the organization? ''My most frequent complaint is the favoritism shown to Drew Bennett because he’s a good looking white guy the girls cream over.  He’s like the Duran Duran of the NFL.  I thought they were insane to give up Justin McCareins.''And, finally, do you have a pet cause to which you wish John Q. Public would devote more attention?''I wish people were more aware of the K Street Project.  I consider its enactors to be less than sewage.— Interview by Adam McKibbin"

  "title": "Cool Beans! Interview",
  "body": "by Matt Kelly, Cool Beans! #4, 23 Sep 94, 1 Oct 94Interview with David Berman and Bob Nastanovich from the Silver Jews.CB: Where does the name Silver Jews come from?David: It doesn't mean anything.Bob: David's Jewish. David lived in Green Point, which is a neighborhood in Brooklyn. He lived by himself, and for Brooklyn, it's safe and it's great if you don't mind being around a bunch of senior citizens.. Mostly middle European. There were a few guys who would hang out a couple of apartments a couple doors down from him, these very old Jewish men. Basically, their term for blonde haired Jews was Silver Jews. He just got a big kick out of that. He realized he was in a band with two blonde gentiles.. He's a Texas Jew. He thought it was an amazing name for the band.CB: How did you guys start out?David: Well, we all went to school together at the University of Virginia, and we started this band called Ectoslavia at school and Steve was in it, I was in it, and a couple other people. Steve was the only one who really knew how to play. We played a few shows in Charlottesville, and Steve was a year older than us, so he graduated and moved back to California. Next year when Bob and I graduated, we moved up to New York and Steve moved to New York and all three of us were living together. We would just basically started out playing into people's answering machines. We'd just moved up to New York and we'd made a friend who worked at a record store in Hoboken who gave us Sonic Youth's phone number. We don't know how she got it, but we'd call them up late at night and play for a long time into their answering machine. They didn't have the kind that shut off, so you could play like 10 minutes. Then we'd just sort of announce who we were.CB: You would just say this is the Silver Jews?David: Yeah, and then we'd just start playing. We'd call other people and basically write songs, you know, 10 a night, everytime we would sit down. We'd record them on a tape recorder too.CB: So you'd make them up on the spot, play them a few times and then record them?David: Yeah. Usually it would just start out like \"this song is going to be-\" to give a specific example, on the first 7\" there's a song called \"Walnut Falcon\" and so if I can remember correctly, we'd been watching PBS nature films, and I said \"we're just going to do sort of a song based on a PBS nature film.\" Steve just started playing, and I started playing, and then we'd sing right on the spot. Usually we'd just sing almost straight out. We did \"Canada\" which was supposed to be a song the Canadian Tourist Bureau could use in a commercial campaign; and then just sort of whatever happens straight out.Bob: All those recordings were recordings of just practice sessions and jams that Silver Jews never intended to put out. We're one of those bands that never really intended to exist. We were just playing because it was like \"oh, that sounds good, we should tape it.\" I mean, there are thousands of bands that do that, but Dan [from Drag City] probably has only listened to 20 of them. So he's the reason why the band exists as far as putting out records.CB: You'd just have the tape recorder on right at first?David: Yeah, we'd just usually work out you know maybe one guitar line and then just turn it on... we never had lyrics worked out, we'd just do that on the spot. Which back then worked real well cause Steve and I are pretty competitive, he'd sing something and I'd try to top him and he would try and top that and I would try to top that and it was just one upping each other and something would be made out of that versus trying to hound yourself into saying something in a room by yourself.Bob: Pavement is mainly Steve's songwriting. It's the principal reason for the band existing. Whereas Silver Jews there's a totally different guy serving the same role. It's a totally different thing, and Steven is really good friends with David and he's a really good guitar player. He really enjoys David's writing, and having the freedom to just jam on guitar and his responsibilities in Silver Jews are absolutely minimal. It's totally great for him to relax. For me, the best two times I've ever been on stage have the two nights we played the Drag City Invitational. There was an intense pressure, and I felt that I was an extremely important part of the band. In Pavement, my role has always been soley live, and pretty much to add spirit and enthusiasm; musically, it's no where near as important as when I'm in the Silver Jews. I have far greater input in Silver Jews. With the new album, we had 12 sheets of paper with lyrics on them and we basically wrote songs around those words.David: Exactly. Yeah, now, for the last couple years it's been mostly songs that either I've written beforehand or Steve and I sat down for a little bit and worked something out more clearly. Because none of that stuff we recorded in the house, which came out on records, was... we were just recording for our own pleasure, you know. We all worked really hard jobs and it was really tense living where we did, and it was fun for us at night to just howl. Afterwards, it became songwriting.CB: So how did Pavement work out of all this? Were the Silver Jews playing together first?David: Well, we played a lot together in college, but we didn't call ourselves the Silver Jews. Steve went home and brought up Pavement, just after he graduated from college.CB: So kind of?David: Well, in a way, technically, on a time-line, yes, first. But, Pavement's always been what Steve does and that's him. Pavement is Steve. Silver Jews as at least until recently, three friends getting together and making music.CB: So you sort of play the role that Steve does in Pavement in the Silver Jews, you're more the-David: Well, on this record especially. I wrote all the songs. Steve is good to have around because he's a complete song stylist and I can bring even a really lame song out and he can polish anything up with what he does. He can make anything into gold. Now, he likes to take more of a backseat, and it's good for me because I've gotten to the point where I have a vision of what I want things to be like whereas before I didn't. I knew what I wanted this record to be like. I knew exactly what I wanted...CB: What is it that you are trying to do with this record?David: Number one, I wanted to make the record that I don't find when I go looking for records. I wanted it to be a record that wasn't cynical, which seems like a lot of records that I see in the stores today are. Where you could hear the lyrics, and the songs told stories. I mean, I'm 27, but... I think a lot of bands that I listen to today, you've got band members that are in their mid-late 20s and they write music for 20 year olds.. 18, 19, 20 year olds. I doesn't seem true. When Neil Young was 24 he sounded like he was 40 already. When I'm 28, I hope to write songs about being 28, or that reflect a 28 year old's life. It's not like the album is strictly for 27 year olds, but I didn't want to hide the fact that I'm not 21. I'm not interested in fast music anymore.CB: So you used to be punk rock?David: Much more than I am now. I'm just more interested in real emotions now and saying something true. I'm not as interested in saying something funny, as maybe I used to have been or saying something as sharp witted or cynical. I just want to make a record that someone could listen to and feel like there were people in the room.CB: I asked Dan from Drag City if he wanted me to ask you anything, and he only had one question.David: What's that?CB: What are you afraid of?David: What am I afraid of? I'm afraid of Dan for one. No, that's a good question, lemme think about that for a second.CB: Do you think that he meant that in relation to his involvement in your projects?David: I'm not sure if he meant that as a general abstract question... or maybe he was making a cut at me cause he's always asking me to play shows and I don't want to. I'd like to think he's asking me a larger question.CB: It could go either way.David: Yeah, really. What am I afraid of? I'm really afraid of hurting people. I'm really afraid of my car breaking down. I'm really afraid of dying before I get things done. I'm really afraid of my landlord's wife.CB: Why?David: She's a battleaxe, she's like a lot of people in Northampton. She's just really really harsh. They live next door, so I always hear her outside. She was yelling this morning at her grandson. Her grandson has this little stuffed owl and she was saying \"The owl goes 'hoot!'\" and she asked her grandson \"Now what does the owl say?\" and her grandson didn't say anything, he was really quiet. She says \"WHAT DOES THE OWL SAY?\" and her grandson didn't say anything and so she said \"THE OWL SAYS 'HOOT!' WHAT DOES THE OWL SAY?!!\"CB: Yeow.David: So, she gives me the creeps.CB: She gives me the creeps too![Laughter]CB: So you're afraid of dying before you get things done. What do you want to get done?David: Well, I'd like to have lots of offspring going well into the next couple centuries. I'd like to write some books. I would like to do some records. I would like to earn a living. I want to see South America.CB: Yeah, me too. I was just thinking about that the other day. Have you read much about South America?David: Only in fiction. I read a lot of Westerns.CB: Have you done much writing? I was told you're a teacher.David: Well right now I'm getting my MFA up here in writing. [U Mass] It isn't that the degree is offering me anything except it does give me a chance to not really work. Teaching doesn't take up any of my time, and I don't have to have another job. So for the three years that I've been up here, which is almost coming to an end, I've had a lot of time to write. When I leave here I want to put together a book of all the things I've been working on and I'd like to write many more. I'm totally committed to writing. I mean, I constantly have a notebook in my pocket and I constantly take that notebook home and enter those notes into another larger notebook. Which I then sit down before almost every single morning and try to string into stories or worlds.CB: So who are you writing for?David: Just myself right now. I haven't had a chance to publish anything.CB: Tell me about \"Secret Knowledge of Back Roads\"Bob: That's one of those songs that was more a Silver Jews song, but it was almost a Pavement song. Pavement played it for a Peel Session track. David also came up with a cartoon called Slanted and Enchanted. He's responsible for the name of that album. Actually.. it was like 6 sheets of paper that were on the wall of our apartment in New York.. God knows where they all are now. But David is the kind of guy who's really anal retentive about files so he may have them somewhere.David: Yeah, I've been writing pretty hard, like every day for about 11 years now, so I have millions of things that are not completed, and I've completed some.CB: Are you more interested in the process than the results of writing?David: It would be nice to be able to say that because it would sort of excuse a lack of results. But I think I would really be into the finished product. I mean, the process is what I do every day.CB: How about applied to the band?David: Well, with the band... I guess it works out well. I mean, I can only do one thing at a time. Like this summer, I went down to Mississippi a month before we recorded to write the songs for the record. I couldn't write anything else. I just could only do the songs. After the record was done I started writing again and now I'm back up here and I've been recording some little things on my four track and I'm trying to do them both at the same time and it's working out a little easier.Bob: The split single with New Radiant Storm Kings is interesting because they are mainly David's friends, and I think the Silver Jews side is something that he did alone. Steven probably played on it, but I definitely wasn't there. I think everything David does musically goes under the name Silver Jews.David: No, it's actually me and West and Malkmus. It just came out a couple weeks ago. It's on this local label called Chunk Records. It's two songs. It's actually called the Silver Jews and Nico. She's on the record at the beginning. I took it off this Velvet Underground bootleg of her -CB: Oh, at a party?David: YeahCB: I've got that bootleg!David: Remember the part where she goes up to I think it's Lou Reed and she says \"What are you doing?\" and he says \"I'm making a record\" and she says \"What is it a record of?\" and he says \"It's a record of us, here.\" and then she's quiet for like 30 seconds and you can hear people talking in the background and she's not saying anything, and as far as I understand, she's staring at the tape recorder wondering what to say, and she leans over real close cause it's real loud and sings \"Good morning, good morning, good morning\" and some drunk guy in the background obviously trying to make it with her says \"yeah, good morning, ehhh...\"CB: So what kind of tape recorder did you guys use when you recorded your early stuff?David: I have it right here, let's see. It's a Sony 1. It's the first in the series. It's like a walkman.CB: Are you familiar with the Mountain Goats at all?David: Actually, I wasn't, until about two weeks ago, I was in New York and a friend of mine asked me to come to this bar, and that guy was playing. And, I mean, the guy was amazing. He was so rigid! I could not believe it. I was just watching him and he was great. I loved it! At first it was so abrasive, I couldn't listen to it and then I just went and sat real close. From far away it was abrasive, but up close it wasn't and I loved it.CB: Why was the identity of the Silver Jews secret for so long?David: I think there's two reasons for that. I don't think the secrecy was intentional...Bob: Yeah, well, I think that's intentional.... but it was unavoidable because I didn't want people to think it was a Pavement side project, which it got to be anyway in people's minds. It seemed like in most reviews though, people focused on the Pavement connection and so it sort of backfired. I told Dan originally to just not say anything about it.CB: But that was the reason that a lot of records were sold right?David: Yeah, that's true. But a lot of times Dan has tried to convince me to play with different people, just so it doesn't become such an issue. I've thought about that, but Steve and Bob are my best friends, and I don't enjoy playing with other people as much. I don't consider myself to be a musician in the sense that I'll play anywhere, anytime. I really only enjoy playing with them. The other reason I think it's seemed so mysterious is because we don't play live very much.CB: How many times have you played live?David: Twice in New York, twice in Chicago. Once was last summer at Irving Plaza, at a Matador showcase and we just came up at the end and played some songs. Pavement wasn't announced, and we'd been practicing for the Chicago shows the Drag City showcase and no one had ever seen Steve West drum in Pavement before, so it didn't matter that there were a bunch of new faces up there. The other time we played in New York was with our friend Sabelle Firat and it was called the War Comet, not the Silver Jews. Since Bob had move to Louisville and Steve and I played together a lot, out of respect for Bob, we called it the War Comet.CB: Who's Sabelle Firat?David: She the sister of Steve's girlfriend. She also plays cello and bass.CB: How often do the Silver Jews get to play together?David: Oh, every few months. Bob lives in Louisville now. So in between tours Malkmus, West and me get to play together. Actually, I think we're gonna play some live shows this winter. I've gotten over my stage fright.CB: Are you gonna hit the road for 9 months like Pavement?David: No, I don't think it'll be like that. But I think we'll play some shows this winter. I'm more into the idea of playing some open mic. nights where you actually have to win an audience over instead of where you before you even start playing everyone is gonna walk out and go \"oh, they were great\" for whatever you do.Bob: I don't know if he would ever tour with the band. Unlike Pavement, I think it's really important for the Silver Jews to feel really naked onstage and instead of when things fall apart, I think we would rather just feel complete humiliation. If things weren't working out we should just leave the stage ashamed. Go for the full circle of emotion. If you're going to be awful, then it's ok. You know. There's no pressure on Silver Jews at all. Any pressure that we have would be completely internal. David finishes school next May, and it really depends on what kind of job he gets and he's sort of in a pre-marital situation. He's been in the same relationship mostly, for the last seven years. It would all depend on really what we could convince him to do.CB: So you produce music now, are you still a large consumer of it?David: I don't know that I listen to many noisy bands anymore.CB: What about other Drag City bands?David: I honestly mean this, I think that Drag City is putting out the most amazing music, and I don't know if that's recognized, except in a smarmy way by people. But I don't think anyone really understands that if Drag City disappeared tomorrow everyone would be talking about how it was the greatest collective of music in a long time. What the Palace Brothers and Royal Trux have done in the last two years is amazing! Those are the two bands that I listen to more than any others of people who are recording today. I think it's because their music is like the first R.E.M. albums which I've been listening to for 10 years and I'm never gonna get tired of them. I know that I'll still listen to the Palace Brothers in 10 years and it will still mean something to me at any age. I feel that way about Royal Trux too. Even when I think Dan is finally out of ideas, he'll pull something out of left field like this new single he just put out by this band Plush. This new single Plush is just incredible. It's one of the most beautiful records I've heard in years. I just keep getting surprised more and more by what he manages to find.CB: How does he find bands?David: I think he's just got weird luck. He's a weird guy. He's one of the best people I know, but he's living in a dream world. He comes up with these plans that no one else would think of. Half of them there's a good reason why no one would think of them. They're horrible ideas. The half of 'em are just amazing and he found 'em. I mean, he has these awful ideas like he really dreams of moving to Orlando. If you ask him why, he'll give you this really vague answer of \"Well, because they have two police forces and two fire departments.\"CB: He's fascinated by Disney World?David: Yeah, like he claims his dream would be to live in a hotel room. He loves the aesthetics of a hotel room.CB: Like a new car thing?David: Yeah, the eternal new car. But he's a genius, he comes up with stuff and I don't think people in Chicago take him seriously. I think that's to his advantage. You know that book The Art of War by Sun Soo [sic]? He says something like \"Even though you are competent, appear to be incompetent. If you are effective, appear to be ineffective.\" That's how Dan is. He just comes out of left field, no one takes him real seriously and he comes up with this brilliant shit. He wants to bring all the bands to Cuba this winter and have a big show. He's been in touch with the Cuban consulate and he's trying to get a flatboat or a fishing boat to drag everyone over and we're supposed to wash up on shore like marines or something.CB: That's amazing. How did he find you?David: I guess he came to a show in Charlottesville once when Pavement was playing, they were on his label still then. We were just talking and I mentioned all the tapes I have at home and he asked me to send them to him. He's always been a big supporter. Sometimes I'll wonder, \"people who are helping me, are they just trying to get to Pavement through the back door?\" But Dan doesn't even give a shit about that. He's always trying to convince me to play by myself or with other people, so I'm really grateful to him for that. I've never known anyone who's as interested in what I've done.CB: He's obviously been interested and been a big fan and taking chances like putting out records that I think a lot of people can't listen to.David: Exactly.CB: It took me a while with the Silver Jews stuff, because there are parts of it you just have to tune out in order to hear the rest of it.David: Exactly.CB: To me, that's a step beyond what most music is like. To have to sit down and really commit yourself to listening to something. You know, it's like reading something you're going to write about instead of just reading.Bob: On nights that we didn't go out, we would sit around and he would try and make songs. I was actually just sitting there all the time trying to watch tv. Usually like Rangers hockey.. we had cable. The drank a lot of red wine... This was sort of at the same time as when Pavement was getting going in a way. But Pavement hadn't ever really been together as a band, while Silver Jews was an opportunity for Steven to play, and David to just explode. His musical experience is about the same as mine. We'd never been in a band together before. But we've been college radio dj's and record collectors and guys who would go see bands. Finally, we started hitting things. He bought a guitar for 50 bucks and a practice amp. If you listen to music and are buying it for 10 or 15 years, you'll probably think about how to do some yourself.CB: When does a band become a band?David: You have to understand.. that every time you go to a show, out of every hundred people or so, a couple of 14 year olds will be on a stage at some point. I don't know where the transformation takes place. When I was in college, listening to music was my whole life. When I was in college, the Butthole Surfers to me were more to me than anything else in the world. Except maybe my girlfriend. But you know what I mean.CB: I do. I felt the same way about the Butthole Surfers.David: It was like a religion, and I know a lot of other people who felt the same way. I think it's strange now, I don't even think about them anymore. I put on their records every once in a while and I'm reminded of the power they used to have, and I wonder where it went. They were an audience at one point, and then they went on to become these amazing performers, and now I don't know what they are.CB: They're a really good example. Because it used to really draw the audience in and be this amazing experience to see the Butthole Surfers and just get all caught up in all of it. But now they're just like the more traditional rock band or something.David: Yeah, there was never a time when I would go see the Butthole Surfers back then when I felt that I was *only* watching. It seems like it would be the opposite, with a band that strange and to look and listen to, you would be the most distant from. Where you would feel like you were watching a freak show.CB: Yeah, I always felt like I knew them, even though I never talked to them.David: I'll never understand how music that was so incredibly frightening could be so human and comfortable.CB: The last time I saw them was in 1989, and that was when it really started to change for me.David: Yeah, exactly. 1989, that was the year when something happened.CB: They didn't have their dancer anymore, and they only had one drummer, and their audience had just like doubled or tripled cause everyone knew how good their shows were. It's weird, cause that's something that a lot of people give me a hard time about, but when a band snowballs into something so big that I feel this huge gap between me and them.. the whole experience is just different. I start to feel like the situation is consumption oriented instead of experience oriented.David: I think that's especially true with bands that you see in that phase. I mean, bands like Led Zeppelin and the Allman Brothers were always meant to be stadium bands, I'm sure they'd sound great in a small club, but other bands, like the Rolling Stones, when I read about them playing in small clubs even in the 70s, I realize that would have been amazing.CB: So do you have any heros?David: Yeah, I have heros. Well, let's see. There are the historical heros, like Andrew Jackson and Sam Houston and then musical heros I'd have to say would be people like Jerry Lee Lewis and David Yow. Well, David Yow is Jerry Lee Lewis. Then there are other people I just totally admire like Cormac McCarthy. Then there's the people I know.Bob: He's my best friend, so it's hard for me to be away from him for large stretches of time. You know, you move into the latter part of your 20s and you start doing way different things. David is a lot different than anyone else I know. He's someone I feel a great sense of attachment to. He's a tremendous source of entertainment. We love him. I think Silver Jews would be more of a band if he was more comfortable playing live.David: In a lot of ways Bob has been, even though he's a close friend.. I look up to all my friends, I look down on them too. But Steve and Bob are constantly inspiring, and I guess that's what a hero is.CB: Yeah, exactly, not that you aspire to be them, but that they motivate you to work on your own stuff and to stay alive. Now why Sam Houston and Andrew Jackson? Because of their myths?David: Yeah, well, I wouldn't ever separate them from their myths; although any biography could do that for me. But yeah, there seems to be some assault right now on great men. I guess those two were both generals, Indian killers and blah blah.. but I admire the strength in each one of them.. and I like when they lived and where they lived. I like that they were able to do so well in those times. So if you feel close to an era, you may feel close to someone who thrived in that era. And of course Robert E. Lee.CB: Wow, all these Southern men, where did you grow up?David: Dallas, Virginia, and Ohio.[click.. tape ran out] "

  "title": "Poetic Groans and Musical Apprehensions",
  "body": "By Robert L. DoerschukThe fine line between poetry and music blurs in the ironic, apocalyptic work of David Berman's Silver Jews. His biggest concern is that people are too dumb to read and too tired to hear. Steven Wright and Larry David grew up to be writer/comedians. Their humor is deadpan and depressed. Each reports on the absurdities of urban life in a listless monotone. Both hide bits of glittering insight inside enigmatic, vaguely disturbing vignettes. Neither, however, plays a guitar or leads a band. That's why we have David Berman. As the founder and locus of the Silver Jews, the Virginia-bred bard creates a rare balance between word and sound. His music is understated, if not narcoleptic. The band - which consists largely of whoever can make it to the studio or the gig - sounds like it had just crawled out of bed. It strums and clunks at low volume, perhaps in order to follow Berman's mumbled vocals. Every now and then it stirs itself into an unconvincing crescendo, only to lose interest after a minute or two. This is perfect accompaniment for Berman's tunes. God forbid that anyone should rip a sizzling solo through, say, \"Random Rules,\" the opening cut on the latest Silver Jews album, American Water. Berman moans the opening line - \"In 1984 I was hospitalized for approaching perfection\" - as if stupefied by a migraine headache. The point here, as in all of Berman's songs, is the lyric. Playing his songs with blazing chops would be like framing a Rembrandt with neon lights. Berman's relationship with words goes back a long way. Born in 1967 in Williamsburg, the son of a restaurant executive, he felt vague literary aspirations at some point in his youth. These led him into higher education, from which he bailed at age 25 with an MFA in English from the University of Massachusetts. With two fellow refugees from academia, guitarist Steve Malkmus and drummer Bob Nastanovich, he recorded a few experimental pieces. Malkmus and Nastanovich were, at this same time, getting nibbles of label interest for their own band, Pavement - which made the Silver Jews' breakthrough that much more unexpected. \"There was no plan,\" Berman remembers. \"Drag City offered to put out Pavement's second seven-inch. Right about that same time Dan and Dan (Dan Osborn and Dan Koretzky, co-owners of the label) came down to meet Stephen. I was around, and kind of by accident they heard these tapes I had been making at home. I never had any ideas they were releasable, but they were interested; they wanted to put them out.\" Which they did in 1993, as an EP titled The Arizona Record. One thing led to another, and soon Berman was in the studio with Malkmus and Nastanovich, cutting the first Silver Jews album, Starlite Walker (1994). \"That, for me, is where the real band starts,\" he says. \"Everything before that seems like sketchbooks. The sketches were released before the work. Usually sketches are released after the main body of work, but our education was caught on tape and released before we actually put it into practice. Two years later, Starlite Walker was followed by a second Silver Jews full-length album, The Natural Bridge, with a fresh lineup of players. American Water, with yet another group of Jews and a guest shot from Steve Malkmus, followed. While all this was going on, Berman was pursuing a parallel career as a poet. His was a familiar voice in coffeehouse recitals around New York, and his works were published in high-cred literary magazines, including Open City and The Baffler. In July 1999, he published his own collection of poems, Actual Air (Open City Books, $12.95). The handiwork there is similar to what we've heard from the Silver Jews, with an awareness of trivial but revealing detail and a fondness for word juxtapositions that seem bizarre and first but make more sense the longer you chew over them. The similarities that bind Berman's prose and music work are as intriguing as the differences that separate them. We had this and more in mind when we spoke with Berman shortly after the release of his book. '''The Inaudible Groove''''''''At the very beginning, was music your main inspiration?'''''I don't know. I've thought back on that, but when I was a little kid, I wasn't really inspired by anything. I don't think you could look back even to when I was 14 and say, \"This person will do something in the arts.\" I wasn't that way. No one in my family had ever done anything in any kind of creative endeavor, especially not for a living. I wasn't a big music fan. I didn't necessarily read a lot. I was kind of like a blank slate. When I got inspired, I think it was more by personality: the people around me, people I worked with, my cousin. I was inspired by social behavior. Then music became talky; it got very social. '''''You didn't play music at all as a kid?'''''Well, I was a music fan. I had a guitar and I would make noise in the basement with my friends. But for the most part, what I like to do is to find blank spots on the map, where I don't think things have been worked out yet. At that point, I really hadn't found a place for anything I could do - especially when I was just making noise in the basement, because we don't need anyone else to make noise in the basement anymore. When I started putting words to songs, I never made any big claims for what I was doing, but I did realize that because it was so word-oriented, it seemed to fill a unique position. In fact, when we started doing songs, it was so lyrically based that we would record on electric guitars without amplifiers, just using them acoustically. The music was always a pedestal to the words. That's been changing over time; it's become more musical in the sense that now we have actual passages of music with no words, where for a long time the minute the song started there was singing, and when it ended there was singing, with no solos or anything. '''''Is the emphasis on the words the reason why textures are so dry on your records?'''''Yeah. It's a conversational vibe. There's always cognizance of the fact that some day this will be for an audience. It's an implicit sort of an idea; it's not something that's ever phrased, that there won't be any production sleight-of-hand. It's just a way to have as few intermediaries between the instrument and the eventual output through the speaker in someone's house. The music tries to be non-deceptive; it gives some respect to the listener. Not that you can't put grandeur into music, but that's just not our strong point. We just do what we can do and try to be real. There's a real discipline to playing very quietly and building dynamics around the flow of words. How hard was it to get the band's latest incarnation to play within those limits? That happened pretty fast. We practiced for about a week before we started recording [American Water], three hours every day. I listened to some of the tapes from the practice. It's funny, because each song took about 10 different forms in the rehearsals. A lot of what turned out to be ballads on the record were faster originally, and \"Blue Arrangements,\" which is a rock song on the record, was more of a ballad. It was mainly contingent on the day we were playing things. I took that into the studio too. We were all keyed personally into each other. We got along very well, and we were partying a lot in and out of the studio. It wasn't a work situation; it was very organic and easygoing. There wasn't too much generaling going on; it was more biological, at the tempo we were feeling that day, at the pace of our own speech and the way our bodies felt. There was some fatigue going on, which for us translates into dynamics. An intellectual energy and a physical fatigue - I think we all felt that. '''''What's the key to sounding good at low volume?'''''Well, we all played live. Because we were playing a low volume, we didn't have to worry too much about bleeding over into each other. None of the vocals were live, of course. We never played more than three takes of a song. Sometimes we would play for 15 minutes because we were enjoying ourselves so much. A lot of the songs that have fadeouts imply the fact that it went on for a long time. It was funny; it was like playing when you know that what you're playing isn't practically useful. We would just keep playing because we were having fun, not because we knew that there was a part we were going to use 15 minutes into a song. It's just that no one wanted to stop. It's like college football versus pro football. '''''That's probably how the longest cut, \"Night Society,\" came about.'''''Yeah, that was at least half an hour long. '''''That was also the only track on American Water that lacked vocals. Were you trying to show that you guys could stretch out instrumentally?'''''Yeah. It's also a respite from all the words. I recognize that there's a barrage of language going on, so these instrumental breaks are to cleanse the palate. Also, we had a different band on this record, and it's a band I could trust to play their instruments, which hasn't always been true in the past. '''Inside American Water''' '''''Is it part of a conscious strategy to keep the sound of the Silver Jews as low-tech as possible?'''''I don't think it's conscious. It's more a kind of after-the-fact strategy, in the sense of, \"Well, we can get away with this stuff because that's what we built our music on all along.\" I don't want to call it laziness, but - and this might be a rationalization - when I was a kid, I can think of so many different songs where I would listen for the mistake. Whether it's on \"The Girl from the North Country,\" on Nashville Skyline [by Bob Dylan]. Or there's a Replacements song on Pleased to Meet Me where Paul Westerberg screams, \"What are you gonna do with your life?\" and Tommy [Stinson, bassist] says, \"Absolutely nothing!\" And you can hear Paul Westerberg laugh, and he drops his tambourine. There's lots of little mistakes like that, which I liked. That's charisma, that's personality. It's not scripted. There's enough music that's choreographed that, again, I can feel like it's a place where we can work and not too many people are working. '''''Did you record the guitar parts on American Water direct?'''''Some of the leads went direct, but mostly it was amplified. '''''What kind of guitar did you use for those open strummed rhythm parts?'''''That's a guitar that everybody I know makes fun of because it's such an '80s instrument. It's an Ibanez Lodestar 2. It's very tacky, but it's my main guitar. '''''It sounds like a hollow-body.'''''But it's not. It's a regular electric guitar. On some songs I would go over the rhythm track with an acoustic guitar, but we'd let 'em both be there together. '''''You use the rhythm guitar strum as a unifying device throughout American Water, but the drum part is constantly changing, even from one section of a song to the next.'''''That's out of necessity. I write these songs in a very simple way. I try to overcome the simplicity with variety on other levels, like the drums. Percussion on a lot of stuff like that is where we try to get a different coloring to what may be constant and stable, which is generally my tone of voice or the guitar. '''''Did you arrange those drum parts?'''''Tim [Barnes] came up with almost everything. Everybody pretty much came up with what they'd play. I would be corrective, in the sense that if I didn't like a part I'd say, \"Try something else.\" The way I instruct someone on how to play is, I'll illustrate a feeling. I'll be like, \"Play like you just got back from a tour of Vietnam.\" Then I'll tell a story. In introducing a song to the players in the first practices, I would tell them the story of the song and how I felt the band should be playing. It was more attitudinal instruction, as opposed to more pragmatic ideas. '''''So on a relatively acerbic track like \"Smith & Jones Forever,\" you'd ask the band to bring more of an edge to their performance.'''''Right. I might say, \"I want you to play with a certain amount of desperation to go along with the characters, but a kind of desperation whose end point is a kind of peace through exhaustion.\" The characters are exhausted people, so you want to play with an exhausted bite. The band needs to be perceptive enough to think in terms of mood and emotion. That's why it was important, when I saw the drummer, to read the vibe on his face, and his actual personality and attitude, and his receptiveness to ideas about charisma and things like that, as much as it was that he could actually play. '''''You hired Tim because of his vibe?'''''Oh, definitely. Personal contact had to be there. Just about a week before we started to practice, I went to a show in New York, and there was a band playing called Ethics Green. I really liked them, but I particularly liked Tim and his drumming, and I liked the smile on his face. I liked his vibe. I asked him to play, and he said yes. '''''In addition to altering the drum parts, you distinguish some songs on American Water by adding elements that nudge them one way or another - a trumpet and a flute on \"Random Rules,\" for example, and a Rhodes electric piano that kicks off \"Wild Kindness.\" How do you find the right effects to add?'''''That's based mainly on suggestion. After the basic tracks are done, we may go in with an idea of doing that, although going into \"Random Rules\" I didn't know what it would be. That's why I like to have a lot of people in the studio who can come up with ideas. I tell them, \"Listen, even if I say no 99 times in a row, I still want you to keep coming up with suggestions.\" A lot of those extra sounds were suggested by Mike [Fellows], the bass player. I would let him have free rein to come up with ideas. A lot of things didn't make it on: Each song might have had four or five overdubs, and maybe two or three would make it on. It was just a process of doing as much as possible with the time we had and worrying later about what we would leave in. '''''Was that scratch/wah-wah figure on \"People\" performed in the basic tracks?'''''That was afterwards. That song didn't have an instrumental ending in practice. This was another example of we enjoyed playing the song and we kept going. Then we were like, \"What can we do on the end here?\" I asked Steve [Malkmus], and he pulled out the wah-wah and played it, and it sounded good. That was also a case of me being interested in making a kind of dance song out of guitar, bass, and drums, without using any kind of keyboards, because I don't think that dance music inherently has to have that. This was as disco as we'd ever get. I was happy to do it with just the basic three. '''''\"Send in the Clouds\" has some cool backwards synth sounds.'''''Those were from two different keyboards that Mike used. I can't exactly remember what they were. That was just a breakdown part. It was like, \"Mike, we're going out for a beer. Put something in here.\" And he did. '''''On \"Like Like The The The Death\" several lines in each verse are delivered with a break in the rhythm, leaving just voice and single notes on guitar. Where did that idea come from?'''''That was a weird one. I wrote that song from three different parts that were glued together. The challenge was to make them cohere. In its initial writing, it was so broken, almost like language/poetry psychedelia, that I became interested in the stop/startedness of the song, and then the chorus seems by comparison to be soaring and broad and muscular. That was an experiment to see how far the song could stretch. It could stretch further because of its origin as a compound of different parts. '''''The only song on American Water that nods to another genre, as opposed to being intrinsic to your own style, is \"Honk If You're Lonely.\" You could peddle that number all over Nashville.''''' That was the idea. A lot of people have said, \"Is that a cover of something?\" It was a songwriting exercise on my part, to see if I could write something that sounded like a '60s country/honky-tonk standard. I have a very distinct idea about what I can do as a songwriter, but I also want to challenge myself to do other things. One of them was to write very simple lyrics and come up with something that could be almost like a standard. It's enough of a blank slate that it could have been anyone's song. It doesn't have a personal imprint. '''''How did you get the band into this less personal cut?'''''I just asked for a kind of celebration. The guy who's singing the song is obviously a lonely loser, but I didn't want it to be dejected at all. It's actually uplifting in some way. I wanted to make sure it wasn't just \"tears in your beer.\" In most songs, I try to find out as soon as possible what clichés it may be playing to, and then I write away from that. '''Vicious Idiocy''''''''Your emphasis on lyrics delivers a pretty clear hint to critics about how to approach what you're doing.'''''I guess, but I do feel like there's been a lot of back-handed praise or negative response to the Silver Jews. '''''What do you mean?'''''Well, you know, I was looking on the Internet the other day. I saw some reviews for Sidewalk.com - and they were essentially the same review from different cities. They started out, \"Try as you might to hate the Silver Jews, they're just too damn good to hate. . . .\" That kind of nailed it on the head: Why would anyone try to hate us from the beginning? There's a big strain of anti-intellectual sympathy in American pop culture. '''''If there's any bastion of pseudo-intellectual criticism in American pop culture, it's certainly in the realm of music journalism. You'd think these people would be thrilled.'''''Who knows? Maybe people attack what they hate about themselves. But I've been constantly surprised at a lot of these rock critics who like to dabble in extrapolating way out of context of what a music can be. When you open Spin, they're trying to make a case for Garbage being a really conceptual deal, with all of these intents and purposes and stuff like that. They're working so hard to make something out of nothing. So when they're given something where work can actually be put into it, as far as listening, there's some stubbornness and reluctance. I've always found that. Lately I've been more unapologetic about the fact that the culture is dumb. The last thing we need right now is more dumbness. There's nothing wrong with intelligence, even though there's this reverse snobbery in the magazine world. '''''Is this a question of the culture being dumb in general or of pop music appealing to a specifically dumb fragment of the culture?'''''There are different fragments of culture, but it seems like, if you find a fragment of the culture that's interested in thought and meaning, it's become commonplace to get your Dumb and Dumber kinds of things as entertainment. Comedy, especially, which a lot of people go for, has kind of come down to - with very few exceptions - laughing at people doing really dumb stuff. Sometimes I feel like you can measure what's going on in a culture by its comedy, and it seems like a lot of smart people, maybe because everything's going so well economically and there's no wars, just want to come home and laugh at people slipping on a banana peel. '''''People have always laughed at the misfortunes of others.'''''That's old, right. '''''But nowadays there's a judgmental aspect to that laughter: This guy deserves to slip on a banana peel because he's too fat, or he's a Republican, or whatever.'''''Yeah, for the most part it's been that way - The Jerk, Steve Martin, things like that. David Letterman added a lot to that: There's a lot of \"at least we're not that way.\" '''''What comedians do you consider exceptions to this trend?'''''I think that Conan O'Brien, what he does on his show, is really remarkable, for the reason that he has been able to bring a kind of benign intelligence into his comedy, where it's smart and it's funny, but it's not imposing and it's not critical. Letterman made the comedy smart, but it's almost like meanness was part of the baggage. And he [O'Brien] took the meanness out of it in a way that I wasn't sure anyone could do. I was like, \"Oh, someone can do this and still keep it smart!\" '''''The assumption is that when there's an edge to something, that edge could be cruel.'''''Or a submerged anger that is actually anger at a different variety of meanness that has no point. I mean, when you listen to Bill Hicks, some people are shocked by it. I don't like everything he does, but he does rail against people buying into the dumbing-down of the culture. It's so unusual to hear someone say, \"Look, this is ridiculous! It's OK to think about things and talk seriously about things!\" It's kind of shocking to hear someone say that, because there's this reverse-snobbery thing, where if you try to talk seriously or fool any character in a movie who's impassioned, unless it's a romantic comedy, it's ridiculous. But if you read a Russian novel, everybody has all that fervor. We're the exact opposite of a Russian novel now: There's no fervor. It shouldn't be one way or another, like people running around and eating their hearts out because life is so painful or there's so much to be done. But it seems like we've gone way over to this other numb, kind of cackling extreme that's a waste of time for me. '''What's In a Word?''' '''''What role does humor play in your music and your poetry?'''''In both of them, it kind of plays the same role, which is as a palliative. I don't feel that comfortable being heavy all the time. I could, but I'm making concessions to the world I live in. So I use humor as a way to say something to get my horse in through the gates of Troy. Or sometimes it's the opposite: I may set up a joke with sadness. But I can never seem to work with just one or the other, or very rarely. They seem to be one and the same. That seems to be part of a Jewish tradition too. There's a nobility to humor, and there's a strength to sadness. So you form a bridge between things that you can't normally see a bridge between. '''''In your lyrics, that often seems to come down to creating short phrases and images that kind of jump off the record.'''''I'm fighting with myself, because there's a natural tendency to go with the cheap shot. '''''There are plenty of examples on American Water: \"Like background singers, they all come in threes.\" And the line about the coda in \"Smith & Jones Forever,\" which is kind of an inside musician's joke. Or \"I've been lonely since she found Christ,\" which is like a country line, but with a sting to it.'''''It's turning clichés on their heads. I'm thinking of my line about the \"honky-tonk psychiatrist.\" Now, when I take a sad situation, like the cliché of someone crying in his beer in a bar, I don't feel that I'm trying to dismantle it by then turning the bartender into a psychiatrist or reducing it to the absurdity of there actually being a psychiatrist in a honky-tonk. I feel that I'm trying to reinvigorate the cliché. So it's not out of a disrespect for these situations; it's in a sense trying to save them from being deadened. '''''And when you approach a level of ire, you do so gently enough to make your point without getting too snarly about it.'''''Yeah. I don't feel comfortable with extremes, and I don't feel comfortable with the middle of the road. So I tend to set extremes next to each other. The title of the record, for instance, with \"American,\" which is maybe as abstract a concept as you can envision, and \"Water,\" maybe the most concrete image you can envision, put together is basically nothing. There's no such thing as \"American water,\" but I like to put two extremes together like that, extremes of humor or extremes of sadness, and see if they can interlock and create a continuity rather than create a friction. '''''Is it really as simple as just juxtaposing unrelated things?'''''Sometimes I do that, and it's kind of a cheap comic effect or a cheap aesthetic effect. But I don't feel like I'm putting them in juxtapositions; I feel like I'm putting things together that have a true natural relationship that's under the radar. It's not an artificial relationship. '''''What do you mean by \"under the radar\"?'''''Well, people classify and categorize elements of life. Like, I have my book here. I'll open it up to any page, and here's a line about \"scars on a toymaker's hand,\" right? \"Toys\" and \"scars\" are put into different categories really easily by people's minds. An old toymaker would most definitely have scars on his hands, but when you look at a toy you're not going to make the bridge back to that. So it's not a weird juxtaposition; it's a true juxtaposition. It's just weird because your mind isn't gonna travel the whole way every time you look at an object, to find all the points that it's a nexus for. '''''Which poem is that?'''''That's in the \"Cantos for James Michener.\" . . . There, again: \"Cantos\" and \"Michener.\" An easy cheap shot. But it was more than that. At first it kind of was a cheap shot, when I wrote it down. But then I started to learn more about James Michener. First he was just the guy with the ridiculous Reader's Digest books on my grandfather's shelves. But then I learned that he had donated his art collection to the University of Texas, and I was living in Austin then, so every week I'd go hang out in that gallery and look at those paintings. Then I started to see that he was a benefactor to the writing program at UT. So it stopped becoming such a joke, and after a while it really was for him, because he was really doing these things. '''''Although the use of the word \"cantos\" . . .'''''Yeah, it's still gonna retain that tease. But you can tease someone lovingly. '''Poetry vs. Music''' '''''There are parallels in your lyric and poetic writing. \"In 1984 I was hospitalized for approaching perfection,\" from \"Random Rules,\" kind of mirrors \"She was destroyed when they were busted for operating a private judicial system within U.S. borders,\" from your poem \"Classic Water.\"'''''Oh, yeah. Everyone gets one weapon, or two weapons if they're lucky. Certainly, if you meet someone who has a method to their fiction writing, you'd find that they use some of those methods in their socializing at a party. As much as artists want you to think they leave their work behind when they leave the desk, it can't be true. '''''So what are the differences between writing for music and writing for the page? Is it just a question of structure?'''''It goes beyond that. There's a certain Charlie Rich-ian emotion that's simple and simplistic, which you can go for in music. That's sometimes achievable in poetry, but it's more difficult, because music plays on the heart. Poetry can play on the heart too, but it takes longer and it's much harder. The real difference is that it's easier to write a song but it's harder to write a good song. '''''Because you can rely on things other than words when writing a song.'''''Right. That's why I have a double relationship with it. I'd rather sit down and write a poem: I know what the materials are. There aren't many variable factors you have to control, like you do in a studio, so there's less anxiety in sitting down to write. But I'll never get as much pleasure out of any poem as I get when a song all comes together, because that's miraculous. '''''Do you sit down with the intention of writing either a poem or a song?'''''Yeah. '''''So ideas come to you in different packages. If you're working on a song, you want to fit everything into eight-bar structures.'''''Yeah, and usually I'll use a more limited palette, in the sense that usually it's gonna be about a man and a woman, or a man alone. I'm not gonna write a song about Isaac Asimov or James Michener; that's too far-flung, and you're asking too much of an audience. And music like that doesn't appeal to me. That's like They Might Be Giants, where everything is a subject. To me, that's goofy. Music requires . . . I won't say more dignity, but it's a different kind of dignity, and a different kind of concession to your audience. '''''Can we assume, then, that audiences for your poetry are more open to elevated ideas than those who might buy Silver Jews CDs?'''''Yeah, I think you can. I mean, I think that if it's the type of person who reads books, by this time in their life they've decided that they're going to a book for a reason. They're not going because they want to hum a song in their head. I mean, there are multiple reasons why someone buys a CD. Some may not be interested in any meaning in the CD; they'll be like, \"Well, I don't listen to words!\" But no one reads a book and goes, \"I don't read the words.\" The words are there. They have one purpose. Music can be other things. '''''Who exactly is your audience?'''''No one really knows anymore. It's so divided, diffused. I've always been amused by the idea of a Book of the Month Club - like, who are the other people in your club? No one really knows. Many times you'll meet a friend of yours and they've read some of the same books, but it took months before you realized they're readers. It's almost like a secret society, except in New York, where it's not so uncommon. But you never really know who reads and who doesn't. I often ask myself that question. I got a box of my books the other day, and I went down to this bar where I know a lot of people, and I was just handing them out. I figured no one was gonna go buy it themselves. But before I would give one to someone, I would say, \"Do you read? I'm not gonna give this to you if you don't read.\" It wasn't a dumb question. It should be a dumb question, but it isn't. A lot of people would be like, \"Uh, no, not really.\" \"When was the last time you read a book?\" \"A couple years ago. In college. It's boring!\" Not to make fun of people like that . . . but, you know, I'm not gonna apologize for making fun of people like that. I'm not talking about people who've never had the chance, who've never been led by the nose to books. These are people who've been to college and have turned their backs on books in the same way that they've turned their backs on the news and turned their backs on other people's suffering. It's like that old William Carlos Williams line, which I can paraphrase: It's hard to find the news in poetry, but men die every day for lack of what is found there. I really believe that. '''''Maybe a project such as the Silver Jews takes that into consideration. You're still addressing serious messages to people, even if it's not an active literary audience.''''' Certainly. I'm glad that my book is coming out, because there will be a lot of Silver Jews fans who don't go to books but who may, for the first time, be convinced that it's not all just John Dryden and Alfred Lord Tennyson. I kind of feel like I'm operating a ministry, like one of those guys on the street corner everyone's laughing at and no one's listening to. Not that my message is religious, but in general, especially for a lot of people today who don't have a spiritual life, you can find one in secular books. That's a kind of modern spirituality. Modernism definitely made that true, or at least tried to make that claim. I still think that's a possibility. '''\"Why Don't You Play Live?\"''' '''''When you began playing gigs with the Silver Jews, did you have to adjust your concepts of what to expect from the audience, compared to the receptions you'd already gotten at poetry readings?'''''Not really. In fact, we've only played shows for captive audiences - like we played last month at a wedding, or at a Drag City event. We've played maybe 10 shows, ever. I feel like what we do is different, almost in a different medium. I feel like I'm in the wrong place, almost like I had accidentally been shoved onstage at a theater where they're expecting a play or something. People may say they want it, and there are Silver Jews fans who say, \"No, we want you to play live.\" But I know the music isn't being served or improved. In fact, nothing is really being done when we play live, except you can see what we look like when we play the music. It sounds either just like the records or not as good. For the most part, when I guess I'm down to the brass tacks, it's to sell records. I know that we could sell probably 50 percent more records if we toured the last three albums, but even though I like to make the records, I'm not interested in selling the records. I want people to buy them, but the record company can sell them, as far as I'm concerned. I'm not gonna play live shows just to sell records. '''''It's probably easier to reproduce the sound of U2 in a stadium than it is to recreate the simple nuances of your records in a club.'''''Exactly, because there's so much moment in it. Sometimes there are mistakes. There's a vibe in the room, that's for sure, that carries a lot of the music, because technique isn't carrying it. So a lot of it is personality or things that you can't just turn on and off on a stage every night, 40 nights in a row. '''''Does the \"anti-showmanship\" riff in your \"Cassette County\" poem reflect this attitude toward performing?'''''Yeah, I was kind of thinking about that. I mean, it's kind of a present thing in my life, whether it's Drag City or people writing letters. Or when I go out at night, if I meet somebody, quite often he's a fan, and he's definitely gonna say, \"Why don't you play live?\" I'm always answering that question, and I'm always coming up with new answers. I don't necessarily know if I can tell them exactly why I don't, but I try to give them a bunch of reasons why I shouldn't. '''''Maybe mystique plays a role here.'''''Exactly. I don't want to ruin it by actually playing live [laughs]. '''The Anti-Message Era''''''''How important are lyrics in music today?'''''I really think we're in a time where you can look at the rise of instrumental music, of dance music, of music even in foreign languages - basically, music where no one has to listen to anyone tell a story or make a point. There seems to be a lot of that. My pet theory is that people go to entertainment that really speaks to them, that really answers their questions or even poses questions, in times of trouble - music that makes them think, makes them feel that there's a search. During the Depression in the 1930s, when people didn't have enough money for heating oil or food, you'd think that the first thing that would go would be money for movies and records. But that was a great boom time for entertainment in America. And now we have an opposite time, where people have never been so financially comfortable, especially in the middle and upper-middle classes. There's very few public issues that are dividing people. You really have to go to the talk TV shows to see people suffering, and it's over interpersonal stuff. I really think that people right now don't want to distract themselves from the fact that they're on this bubble. And what's better for that than some instrumental dance music? You can play it in your brand new car on your way to shop. If you put on, you know, \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall,\" you might start to look around outside of your brand new VW bug parked outside of the Gap and start to worry, like, \"Wait a second. Is this all really gonna last this way?\" I mean, at no time in history have we ever gone this long without a war! Any music that comes on and makes you ask if life can really be this way is gonna make you fucking anxious. So why not turn off the words? That's what the music and the TV does now. '''''During the Depression, you had both \"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\" and \"We're in the Money.\" Both confrontation and denial.'''''But we don't even have a \"We're in the Money\" in the sense that people will explicitly say that, even though they are [in the money]. People are trying to hide that. It's kind of like, no one's into conspicuous consumption, like in the '80s. But really, it's so conspicuous: Instead of big Cadillacs, it's SUVs. They're practical! So nobody's saying \"We're in the Money,\" and nobody's saying \"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\" either. It's just the music. '''''What does that mean to you as a musician?'''''Well, I keep wondering, should I be making music? Or should I just dump it and say it as clearly as I can through the page? It really comes down to how can I get the message out, because I want people to hear it! I'm not here just to bounce words off the walls. That's a decision I'll probably make over the next couple of years: Am I gonna keep making records? Is anyone really listening to this? Or should I just go for a smaller audience that I know is listening? '''''Which of your songs works best as a vehicle for your message?'''''The song on American Water, \"We Are Real,\" is one of those songs where, if you're not listening, it's not gonna be clear. But it's all there. What I mean is, you can be fooled by how quiet and folky and gentle it is, but the lyrics are actually extremely angry. It's kind of about a lot of what we're talking about: feeling like the world is trying to make you into a consumer when you know you're a human. To me, that was the most political song I ever did, in the sense that I really felt like what I was saying to anyone who was listening was, \"Come on, stop putting your faith in people who, above all, keep you shopping.\" People put their faith in people like that, whether it's government officials who need you to keep shopping, or business people who need you to keep shopping, or entertainers who need the commercials to keep going. So that was one where at least I knew what I was saying. When I was younger, I never would have said anything political like that in a song. I would have felt embarrassed. '''''How do such lyrics come about? Do you sit down with the intention of writing something political?'''''No, the beginnings are more stream-of-consciousness. I may have written down the words \"we are real\" somewhere, not knowing what I meant by it. Then I'll try to figure out what I meant by that. . . . Well, not what I meant by that, but what it could mean. I'm kind of in reverse, reading my own song and trying to figure it out. '''''Are any projects being planned for the Silver Jews?'''''We're gonna try to make a record in the fall. Me and Malkmus are going to Cambodia for a month at the end of December, so we'll try to do it before then. '''''Why Cambodia?'''''Well, a friend of mine has an apartment in Phnom Penh, and I've never been in such a place. It just seemed like a crazy idea to be there in 2000. '''''You may in fact be there for several months, depending on how Y2K plays out.'''''Who knows? I may be there for the rest of my life."

  "title": "Silver Jews - Tanglewood Numbers",
  "body": "Gather 'round, Silver Jews fans and detractors, and hear the tale of David Berman's past four years. After intentionally overdosing almost two years ago - despite the well-received 1999 poetry book ''Actual Air'' and 2001 album ''Bright Flight'' - Berman is back. On ''Tanglewood Numbers'', he's reunited with on-and-off again band members Stephen Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich (former Pavement drummer Steve West is also on this LP) and a host of others from his Nashville neighborhood and beyond. Berman's descent into drugs and the requisite redemption hasn't changed everything about the Silver Jews, but it's changed a lot. The heartrending aspects (childlike wonder, grown-up wit) of Berman's vocals and lyrics are intact. Malkmus' guitar still perforates the most pognant, aching moments and one-liners (\"How can I love you if you won't lie down?\") like a bayonet to the gut. Cassie Berman features prominently on vocals (a twangy, clear foil to her husband's deep growls), and the production is built to withstand the layers  created by the 15 or so players. What's missing most will probably not be missed at all: Berman's tendency to sound slack, sluggish and a bit lackluster. He cares more now, and caring always hurts more but yields better results.MAGNET contacted Berman in his Tanglewood Street home.'''It's been four years since ''Bright Flight''.'''For a lot of reasons, I just sunk deeper into drugs and just waited around to die. Eventually, I decided to finish the whole thing off. The rest is somewhat predictable: detox, rehab, God, comeback, confetti, hush money, sexposé, prosecution, bartending school.'''Were you working on ''Tanglewood Numbers'' before you overdosed?'''No. I lost about three years of work, in the sense that I didn't do any. I started writing these songs last July, after I'd been home about six months.'''Your wife's singing plays a larger role than ever. Does that reflect a permanent change in the Silver Jews' lineup?'''Things change and change back. I never like when bands changed for good, letting you know they'd never be the same again. I want the band to be the same again when that's what the song needs. For the people who love the Silver Jews, we will be their rock. That's a new guarantee.'''Your albums tend to inspire love/hate reactions. Do you hope ''Tanglewood Numbers'' will change that?'''I hope it gets to those who have ignore the band or have been discouraged from listening to the albums. As for the haters, let them picket the awards dinner when I'm inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. I can just see it now. It's January, in the future, and old (rock critic) Jim !DeRogatis is all bundled up against a bitter wind coming off Lake Erie, steam coming out of his maw. He's breathing hard, leaning against a frosted flagpole, with a rough-hewn picket sign fallen at his feet. It is only then that you notice he's bleeding.'''Is it true you're about to begin writing your first novel?'''No. I could never write a novel. I feel a moral responsibility to do the work I'm best at.[http://www.dragcity.com Drag City]"

  "title": "Nervous Ashers: The Legend of the Silver Jews",
  "body": "by David BermanThere were mountain huts full of smallpox strung out along the hillsides between Escatawpa and Morgan City, birds boiling up and out of freestanding chimneys under the routine advent of rainbows and chainsaws, the old sound of cheap labour rising and falling in the weather that was like frosted bank glass and advancing. There were heaps of tangled sawhorses and tripwire, vacant jasper and wolframite mines, mounds of dead Ataris and scarred desk drawer Bibles scattered across the abandoned counties that lay inert as rope.Hazel and Bobby lived together in an old slave shack I used to rent out in the upper fields. They cut Canadian thistle and picked sloe berries off the blackhorn for a living, slashing their hands and bickering all day in the frayed heat, visiting me in the cool mainhouse most evenings. We'd sit in the rooms without ceilings, drinking whitehill whiskey under the recombinant stars, and Bobby, who loved to go on about things, would reminisce about his dead wife who had contracted a disease from sleeping too close to the fan. On Sundays they would not move a muscle. They would just sit there like two piles of coins quietly warming through the afternoon, then slowly cooling off over the evening.Bobby puts on his sound jacket. Shards of hospital bed are locked in the bass drum. Through the worn dolichoid rafters i can see birds flying over the practice room. The snare is stuffed with traffic tickets and out the window there's my horse walking on the stream, the stream always behind schedule. There's a dust mote hawk landing in slo-mo on my guitar. Hazel's saying something about Earnest Wourls over in Tullahoma who'd had a dream about being a cougar sleepwalking on Polk's grave and how that was bad luck for the region. (\"Those that look through the window are darkened.\" All those faces passed down through the centuries that kickstart the rivers and grow like nerve endings in a coal cart until until they are key-cold and shoved through the repaired death gate, a catafalque set free and released into the dirtways.) \"And John and his father trap mink under the chain lightning in the libraries they've landed in, where all the talk about shadow-dappled paths is typeset, published, and poured into a break in the earth,\" Hazel murmured to no one in the room. You might think it was all words and dark ticket as we began to play \"R.M.T.\" in the swarming weather chart sundown, and it was.Outside, you would still hear the music, hear someone yelling \"actors dreaming got nowhere to stay/ see my sheet go walking run and fly\" and it would sound better from far away, like the faded sketch of a long since forgotten pacer at the downs, all the while platinum ticks are dropping off the trees like little Romans, onto an auburn shower curtain half-buried in the forest floor.Already gone were the golden days of E-Z credit, the days of approaching squat south-central skylines from underneath the ice blue tides of the windshield, the five cent war comets, howling saran yaps and careening school chords. All that was left, looking like two lost eyeballs on the field after Spotsylvania, were a couple of black plastic busted knobs in the dirt, one for tone and one for rinse.This place is like a haunted turnpike, closed down for years , where things still happen in the little turnoffs to the renowned teenagers that never come back (sold to the haunt in the black church). If you come in the day and you're lucky, you might catch a picture of two sweatbees fucking on a coke mirror. You might see my horse breaking across a white wine coloured clearing, or maybe hear the old chords coming, for no real reason, out of sockets in the walls. (\"Because there's an answering machine clogged with ice, deep in the courthouse mountains where he lived and died in the breech.\")"

  "body": "A Mixtape by Cassie Berman of the Silver JewsFrom http://www.discollective.comThere's nothing like a good song to free your mind on the open road. Some of my earliest memories are the twin Willies, Boxcar and Nelson, singing of trains and a-travellin' on our family 8-track. Whether it be by plane, train or motorcycle - where there's a wheel there's a tune it seems. To celebrate the kick-off of the Silver Jews first ever tour, I present to you my favorite music to get a move on.== Tracks ==1. Free Born Man - Jimmy MartinThis spirited anthem of a life-long drifter is delivered with such conviction you'd swear there was such a thing as bluegrass punk.2. Rolling O - King KongA big ol' sugar rush of fun to help the kids in Louisville kick Slint. Great for bumpy roads.3. 1952 Vincent Black Lightning - Richard ThompsonHanding the motorcycle keys to a red-headed girl in black leather on your death bead. One sick ballad.4. Racing in the Street - Bruce SpringsteenI think the Boss holds the record on songs about cars. \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\" is one of my all-time knock me down favorite albums. The first time I heard this tune was sung by Guy Clark. I happened to be on his back porch with a bunch of old drunk friends during a late night thunderstorm and he happened to know the secret key to unlock the universe for us.5. Stratford-On-Guy - Liz PhairA night flight to Chicago will be forever more sexy. Thanks, Liz.6. Voodoo Cadillac - Southern Culture on the SkidsThis baby's got a hunk-a-hunk-a bass line. Cruising the streets listening to \"Dirt Track Date\" even makes my Volvo ride a little more funky.7. Hard Road - Lucinda Williams \"With the spirit to guide you/And a friend beside you/You know you'll win/If you're only willin\" - Play this song and you'll never feel alone cross the miles.8. Riding with Mary - X Oh Exene Cervenka, if only I could be you. A couple hours obsessing over X is a good way to pass the time on long drives.9. The Way - Fastball This song was on the radio one summer when David and I lived in a mega-complex by the Mall called Mallard's Crossings. I would listen to the song by the pool and dream away.10. The Letter - Box TopsThis song has an emotional pull so strong I feel like I'm the one that got the letter whenever I hear it. I took guitar lessons from Gary Tally, the guitar player in the Box Tops, when I first moved to Nashville. Lessons from legends for $25/hr can't be beat. Although he totally lost me with the \"color chords\" schema. == Honorable Mention ==Elvis Theme Music - Elvis Presley   Technically this is not a \"song\" but there is nothing like the Elvis theme music (da da da -- da da da) to get me on my feet. A life long session player round here says they call this kind of thing \"walk-in music.\" I guess that's cuz that's what the band plays whenever a star takes the stage. Or \"exits the building\" in this case. I just think it's so exciting sounding!Take the Skinheads Bowling - Camper Van BeethovenI've just always wanted to put this song on a top ten list. It really is not about traveling, unless you count the Ten Pin as a destination.Okay, that is all. "
