## Reviews

### Magnet

Gather 'round, Silver Jews fans and detractors, and hear the tale of David Berman's past four years. After intentionally overdosing almost two years ago - despite the well-received 1999 poetry book "Actual Air" and 2001 album "Bright Flight" - Berman is back. On "Tanglewood Numbers", he's reunited with on-and-off again band members Stephen Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich (former Pavement drummer Steve West is also on this LP) and a host of others from his Nashville neighborhood and beyond. Berman's descent into drugs and the requisite redemption hasn't changed everything about the Silver Jews, but it's changed a lot. The heartrending aspects (childlike wonder, grown-up wit) of Berman's vocals and lyrics are intact. Malkmus' guitar still perforates the most pognant, aching moments and one-liners ("How can I love you if you won't lie down? ") like a bayonet to the gut. Cassie Berman features prominently on vocals (a twangy, clear foil to her husband's deep growls), and the production is built to withstand the layers  created by the 15 or so players. What's missing most will probably not be missed at all: Berman's tendency to sound slack, sluggish and a bit lackluster. He cares more now, and caring always hurts more but yields better results.

MAGNET contacted Berman in his Tanglewood Street home. "It's been four years since "Bright Flight". "For a lot of reasons, I just sunk deeper into drugs and just waited around to die. Eventually, I decided to finish the whole thing off. The rest is somewhat predictable: detox, rehab, God, comeback, confetti, hush money, sexpos√©, prosecution, bartending school. "Were you working on "Tanglewood Numbers" before you overdosed? "No. I lost about three years of work, in the sense that I didn't do any. I started writing these songs last July, after I'd been home about six months. "Your wife's singing plays a larger role than ever. Does that reflect a permanent change in the Silver Jews' lineup? "Things change and change back. I never like when bands changed for good, letting you know they'd never be the same again. I want the band to be the same again when that's what the song needs. For the people who love the Silver Jews, we will be their rock. That's a new guarantee. "Your albums tend to inspire love/hate reactions. Do you hope "Tanglewood Numbers" will change that? "I hope it gets to those who have ignore the band or have been discouraged from listening to the albums. As for the haters, let them picket the awards dinner when I'm inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. I can just see it now. It's January, in the future, and old (rock critic) Jim !DeRogatis is all bundled up against a bitter wind coming off Lake Erie, steam coming out of his maw. He's breathing hard, leaning against a frosted flagpole, with a rough-hewn picket sign fallen at his feet. It is only then that you notice he's bleeding. "Is it true you're about to begin writing your first novel? "No. I could never write a novel. I feel a moral responsibility to do the work I'm best at.
