Call me from Albemarle Station if you can  
I hope you find your concentration beneath those ceiling fans  
We used to dance in this split-level ranch  
when moonlight flooded the room  
Now you're gone and the shades are all drawn  
in my air conditioned tomb Bad roads, bad snow, bad bridges  
could turn a once bad man religious  
if thy kingdom ever comes  
you better run, run run run There must be a spanish word for this feeling  
the rush I get when I am stealing  
from the Dust Congress  
whose dollars and dimes  
say "in dust we trust"  
oh yeah  
the world is not ready for you I passed an abandoned drive-in  
with ivy growing over the screen  
It was like I caught Hollywood sleeping-  
sleep without the dreams A magic shop in Colonial Watts  
something gets pushed by the wind  
The world's not ready  
the world's not ready  
the chimes of rabies are ringing again Bad roads, bad snow, bad bridges  
could turn a once bad man religious  
if thy kingdom ever comes  
you better run, run run run There must be a pool out behind the church  
cause he looked so cool in the back of a hearse  
After a debutante of his trial  
all the citizens began to dress in his style  
oh yeah, it's a beautiful, beautiful world
