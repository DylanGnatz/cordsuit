When God was young, he made the wind and the sun  
Since then, it's been a slow education  
And you got that one idea again  
The one about dying.  

_Chorus:_  
Oh oh oh I'm lightning  
Oh oh oh I'm rain  
Oh oh oh it's frightening  
I'm not the same, I'm not the same,  
I'm not the same  

There's a screen door banging in the wind  
Remember you wanted to be like George Washington back then  
Everybody's going down on themselves  
No pardon me's or fare thee wells in the end  

(Chorus)
