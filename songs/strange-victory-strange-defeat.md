Squirrels imported from Connecticut  
Just in time for fall  
How much fun is a lot more fun?  
Not much fun at all  
What's with all the handsome grandsons  
In these rock band magazines?  
And what have they done with the fat ones?  
The bald and the goatee'd?Strange victory!  
Strange victory!  
Strange victory!  
Strange defeat

A tale is told of a band of squirrels  
Who lived in defiance of defeat  
They woke up in the nightmare world  
Of craven mediocrity  
They said, "We're coming out of the black patch!  
We're coming out of the pocket!  
We're calling into question  
Such virtue gone to seed! "Strange victory!  
Strange victory!  
Strange victory!  
Strange defeat

Strange victory!  
Strange victory!  
Strange victory!  
Strange defeat.
