Pain works on a sliding scale  
So does pleasure in a candy jail  
True love doesn't come around any more than fate allows on a Monday in Ft. Lauderdale  
I came all this way to see your grave  
To see your life as written paraphrased  
I have tried be it is written in the furnace of affliction  
This is what you couldn’t face.

Life in a candy jail  
Peppermint bars  
Peanut brittle bunk beds and marshmallow walls  
Where the guards are gracious  
And the grounds are grand  
And the warden keeps the data on your favorite brands.

Jelly beans and cookie dough  
Country restroom on a radio  
I got a number on my name  
It’s hard to rise above the shame  
I’m a branded man made in the mold.

These terms engulf the waking mind.  
Like cherry, grape and lemon-lime  
Like candy corn and licorice  
Like bubble gum and Swedish fish  
It happens to me all the time.

Living in a candy jail  
With peppermint bars  
Peanut brittle bunk beds  
And marshmallow walls.

Where the guards are gracious  
And the grounds are grand  
And the warden really listens  
And he understands.
