What is not but could be if  
What could appear in the morning mist  
With all associated risk  
What is not but could be if

What was not but could have been  
Was my obsession way back when  
Now I just remember this  
What is not but could be if

What is not but could be if  
We could be crossing this abridged abyss  
Into beginning

When failure’s got you in its grasp  
And you’re reaching for your very last  
It’s just beginning

One has lived life carelessly  
If he or she has failed to see  
That the truth is not alive or dead  
The truth is struggling to be said

So how do we get out of this  
Family shadows all of this  
Through what is not but could be if  
With all associated risk

What is not but could be if  
We could be crossing this abridged abyss  
Into beginning

When failure’s got you in its grasp  
And you’re reaching for your very last  
It’s just beginning
