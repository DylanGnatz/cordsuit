I passed out on the fourteenth floor  
the CPR was so erotic  
a blizzard blew in through the door  
and little glowing cum buckets in her ankles O Dallas you shine with an evil light  
O Dallas you shine with an evil light  
How'd you turn a billion steers  
into buildings made of mirrors,  
and why am I drawn to you tonight? Once you taste the geometry of a church in a cul-de-sac  
you're gonna wanna sit with the bad kids in the backCruising down Commerce  
killing time in the blazing sun  
Is it true your analyst was a placekicker for the Falcons?We saw B.B. King on General Hospital  
in the Oak Cliff dram house where we stayed  
and when Clancy whipped her with his belt buckle  
we cleaned her cuts and then we prayed

O Dallas you shine with an evil light  
Don't you know that God stays up all night?  
And how'd you turn a billion steers  
into buildings made of mirrors,  
and why am I drawn to you tonight? Watching the makeup girls make out with the mannequins  
"Hey boys, supper's on me, our record just went aluminum" Poor as a mouse every morning  
rich as a cat every night  
Some kind of strange magic happens  
when the city turns on her lights
