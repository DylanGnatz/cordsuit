Guard my bed  
while the rain turns the ditches to mirrors  
by a vase of carnations from central Ohio  
where the looking machine can't hear us Deep in the night we dream of positions  
there's a line for the phone in the hall  
and in the cold places where Spanish is spoken  
most wars end in the fall You never know when your pet will go  
pet politics (x4) Still wearing last night's mascara  
now that her pet was gone for sure  
she was shivering so hard  
it looked like there were two of her I could see through the sleeve of her blouse  
the plans of her architect lover  
a tattoo of a boarded-up house  
and ink door that belonged to another When the rain hits you  
it hits you slow  
stitch after stitch (x4) Adam was not the first man 'though the Bible tells us so  
There was one created before him, whose name we do not know  
He also lived in the garden  
but he had no mouth or eyes  
One day Adam came to kill him  
and he died beneath these skies I find it so amazing how  
I go where I'm led (x4) I suspect we could be losing now  
please guard my bed  
please guard my bed  
please guard my bed  
please guard my bed
