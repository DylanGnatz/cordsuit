I was 19, and dead from the neck up.  
She was a Christian rock ingenue.  
Sentimental as a cat's grave  
Her fucking body broke my eyes  
And she said, I'm gonna love the hell out of you.

Brandy wine rained on an android cross  
Even the swans were bankrupt and blue  
I'd been a liar my whole life  
She said, I wanna be your wife  
And she said, I'm gonna love the hell out of you.

In a lonely swedish bookstore, banging a librarian  
The sound of rain and lightning was my cue  
I fixed the Preakness in the rain  
I had a weakness for cocaine  
And she said

I learned double entry bookkeeping when I was 12 years old  
I learned there's no imagination in the blues  
They registered my name with the Catholic hall of fame  
And she said, I'm gonna love the hell out of you.
