Tide to the oceans  
a million chuckers never felt wrong  
looking at you, I'm a staring  
looking how you make me feel good now  
Broken like you know the child diction  
over at the naked show  
Sarah couldn't make you feel down now  
down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down now (chorus) Wait, for the last man  
last man never had a chance  
so he went out behind the shed  
and bought himself a little cigarettes  
On the ground digging for a treasure map  
find your answer  
when you ask, please ask me  
ask me to stay. (chorus)
