cranes on the downtown skyline is a sight to see for some  
it ought to make a few reputations in the cult of number one  
while these seconds turn these minutes into hours of the day  
while these doubles drive the dollars and the light of day awaysuffering jukebox such a sad machine  
you're all filled up with (what) other people need  
and they never seem to turn you up loud  
got a lot of chatterboxes in this crowdsuffering jukebox in a happy town  
you're over in the corner breaking down  
they always seem to keep you way down low  
the people in this town don't want to knowwell I guess all that mad misery must make it seem to true to you  
but money lights your world up, you're trapped, what can you do?  
you got Tennessee tendencies and chemical dependencies  
you make the same old jokes and malaprops on cuesuffering jukebox such a sad machine  
you're all filled up with (what) other people need  
hardship, damnation and guilt  
make you wonder why you were even builtsuffering jukebox in a happy town  
you're over in the corner breaking down  
they always seem to keep you way down low  
the people in this town don't want to know
