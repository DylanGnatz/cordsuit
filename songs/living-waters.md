Now people are good and people are bad  
and I'm never sure which one I am, so  
come in out of the storm  
what you need is an imitation of home, alright you're at home  
you're all alone  
and nobody's calling on the telephone People are good and people are bad  
people they butch, people they brag  
people they test, people they breast(?)  
people name sex as their favourite thing to do

So if you run, then run to me  
and if you can swim then swim to me  
just come in out of the storm  
what you need is an imitation of home you're at home  
you're all alone  
and nobody's calling on the telephone
