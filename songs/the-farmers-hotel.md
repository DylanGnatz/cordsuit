the lights went out in New York, then they went in Goshen.  
I got stuck in Goshen and that was sad.  
the townsfolk stared hard like their minds had been marred  
by life in a district so downtrodden and drab.

I flagged down a stranger in a worn wooden wheelchair,  
and when I asked if he knew of a hotel  
he said "if I get your meaning, then I'm definitely leaning  
towards recommending the Farmer's Hotel. "as I left to find the place, a mother looked me in the face  
and whispered "please sir, not the Farmer's Hotel. "  
once where I was headed, she swore I would regret it,  
what might happen she wouldn't foretell.the old place it was vicious, wicked and pernicious,  
"please stay clear of that rank abattoir. "  
though her words alarmed me, I was stuck until morning  
and in the end we must be who we are.with no light on the door, I wasn't quite sure  
if a night clerk was working within.  
from behind a red curtain limped a perilous person.  
he appeared to have some egg on his chin.this old yankee warlock brushed back a gray forelock  
and he motioned me to sign in the book.  
with no bonhomie he proffered the key.  
never once did he give me a look.

I thanked the old codger, and in my role as the lodger,  
I headed upstairs for to sleep.  
there was no air of slumber, the doors they had no numbers  
which room was intended for me?the passage kept on going like the carpet was flowing  
towards that thing at the end of the hall.  
my own eyes had adjusted.  
my account can be trusted,  
cause I know that I saw what I saw.

I heard animal noises and tangled up voices  
chanting more and of rumors of more.  
there's no natural law that can explain what I saw  
spread out on that straw-covered floor.now I've put an ocean between myself and Goshen  
to get away from the Farmer's Hotel.  
things so unclean, are better left unseen.  
keep away from the Farmer's Hotel.the lights went out in Goshen, just like poetry in motion,  
and I checked into the Farmer's Hotel.  
so if you get a notion to travel to Goshen,  
please stay away from the Farmer's Hotel.Â© D.C.
