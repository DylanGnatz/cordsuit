Baby won't you take this magnet and maybe put my picture back on the fridge.  
I must have been crazy, to let you get away like you did.  
And like a brown bird nesting in a Texaco sign I got a point of view,  
And the kicker is that, I'm getting back in getting back into you.

I guess over time we became ducks, I never seemed to see you much.  
Then the world turned, time got away, we fell out of touch.  
I've been working at the airport bar, it's like Christmas in a submarine.  
Wings and brandy on a Winter's night: I guess you wouldn't call it a scene.

Now my ex-wife's living in the suburbs with her guru and her mom.  
Now she finds her consolation in the stardust of a bong.  
You can call it a spinoff, say it's a knockoff, title it part two.  
But I'm getting back into getting back into getting back into you.  
I'm getting back into getting back into getting back into you.
