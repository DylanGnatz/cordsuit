fast cars,  
fine ass,  
these things  
will pass,  
and it won't  
get more  
profound.time is a game only children play well.  
how can I love you if you won't lie down?bayou.  
doorbell.  
who's who,  
in hell?  
my kingdown  
for a crown.time is a game only children play well.  
how can I love you if you won't lie down?
