I see you gracefully swimming with the country club women  
in the Greenwood southside society pool.  
I love your amethyst eyes and your protestant thighs  
you're a shimmering socialite jewel. 

From the Carbon Dioxide Riding Academy  
to the children's crusade marching through the downtown.  
Well I think I'd die see, if you just said hi to me.  
When something breaks it makes a beautiful sound. 

Sometimes I feel like I'm watching the world  
and the world isn't watching me back.  
But when I see you, I know I'm in it too.  
The waves come in and the waves go back.  

The kids in the corner all covered in dirt.  
Caught trespassing under the moon.  
My father came in from wherever he'd been  
and kicked my shit all over the room. 

The room is dark and heavy with what I want to say.  
I see murals in the radio static and on your blue jeans.  
What would you say if I asked you to run away?  
It's been done so many times I hardly know what it means. 

I took these blue arrangements and threw them in the sea  
when older waves from older caves brought them back to me.  
I took these blue arrangements and stored them on a shelf.  
With change on the mantle and time in a candle,  
in the end a boy raises himself.
