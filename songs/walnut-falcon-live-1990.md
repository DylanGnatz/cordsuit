On a snowy mountaintop  
Two rams go head to head  
Horns go thwap  
Horns go thwap  
And I'm looking for my snowy bed

I dream about, but I don't know the way  
I dream about the swarm  
I dream about the swarm  
I dream about the swarm  
I dream about the swarm

Walnut falcon comes flying down  
Wing span as long as this town  
Seeds of prey in its little black eye  
I shift in looking for the dog in the rain

And the walnut falcon will soar  
Into my heart, away from the ?Dream about the swarm  
Time is the lonely thing  
Time, time is the lonely thing  
Time, time is the lonely thing  
Time is the lonely thing

I can dream about but makes me go away  
Dream about the swarm
