Are you honest when no one's looking?  
Can you summon honey from a telephone?  
They sat there with their hooks in the water  
and their moustaches caked with airplane glue. O come let us adore them

California overboard  
when the sun sets on the ghetto all the broken stuff gets cold. Chorus::Smith and Jones forever!:Smith and Jones forever!:Smith and Jones forever together forever and ever. Build a stage for Autumn's bitch.  
They walk the alleys in duct tape shoes.  
They see the things they need through the windows of a hatchback  
The alleys are the footnotes of the avenues. O come let us adore them  
California overboard  
holding up their trousers with extension cords. (chorus) I've got two tickets to a midnight execution.  
We'll hitchhike our way from Odessa to Houston  
and when they turn on the chair  
something's added to the air  
when they turn on the chair  
something's added to the air forever (chorus)
