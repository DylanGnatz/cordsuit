Troubles, no troubles, on the line,  
I can't stand to see you,  
I can't stand to see you when you're crying at home.  
Scotch & penicillin, please try Carlton,  
a cold black maple hanger and husbands on the run  
I just got back from a dream attack  
that took me by surprise  
and in there I met a lady, her name was Shady Sides  
and she said:  
"It's been evening all day long,  
it's been evening all day long  
and how can something so old be so wrong".  
Sin and gravity  
drag me down to sleep to dream of trains across the sea,  
trains across the sea.  
Half hours on earth, what are they worth, I don't know.  
In 27 years I've drunk fifty thousand beers  
and they just wash against me like the sea into a pier.
