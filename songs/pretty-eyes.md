Everybody wants perspective from a hill  
But everybody's wants can't make it past a window sill  
I can see you in your room at night  
Pictures on your walls  
Little forest scenes and high school Halloweens  
But they don't come to you  
They don't come to you at all

All houses dream in blueprints  
Our houses dream so hard  
Outside you can see my shoeprints  
I've been dreaming in your yard One of these days these days will end  
Thru the kitchen window the light will bend  
You'll be carving a pumpkin with a knife  
when someone at the table says  
"That's not what I call a life! " The elephants are so ashamed of their size  
Hosing 'em down I tell them "you got pretty eyes"  
Out in the backyard I used to make like I was a cowboy  
I'd set my dog before a hoop and say "now boy, now boy! " When the governer's heart fails  
The state bird falls from its branch  
Icicles on hell's higher hills  
Meanwhile back home at the ranch  
I still get up early in the morning  
And I never knew a better place I believe the stars are the headlights of angels  
Driving from heaven to save us  
To save us  
Look in the sky  
They're driving from heaven into our eyes  
And though final words are so hard to devise  
I promise that I'll always remember your pretty eyes  
Your pretty eyes
