I'm gonna love you for a hundred years.  
Through suffering and celebration dear  
Cause only you can make my lies come true  
You can make lies real,  
You can make me feel,  
Like drinking wine in the shade all afternoon

You keep finding and reminding me,  
That you only can be kind to me,  
When you got with me you started dreaming my dreams.  
But darling, there's a gun in the garland,  
And you need to know,  
That the dream is not all dream.

Chorus:  
Room games and diamond rain  
It's a fox hunt, it's a f-stop  
It's a ten acre wood.  
Outbound on a western train  
It costs a quarter man  
Out on the borderland  
And I can dance real good.

A freight train rattles the chandelier,  
And if we're like plug-in reindeer,  
Whose cords can't stretch far enough to fly,  
We're gonna take a ride in the dirt,  
We're gonna die until it doesn't hurt,  
And then they can bury us side by side.(Chorus)
