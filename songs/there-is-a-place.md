Police Conversation 1783I saw God's shadow on this world  
I saw God's shadow on this world  
I saw God's shadow on this world

I could not love the world entire.  
there grew a desert in my mind.  
I took a hammer to it all.  
like an insane medieval king.

I saw God's shadow on this world  
I saw God's shadow on this world  
I saw God's shadow on this world  
I saw God's shadow on this world

I could not love the world entire.  
there grew a desert in my mind.  
I took a hammer to it all.  
I took a hammer to it all.

I saw God's shadow on this world  
I saw God's shadow on this world  
I saw God's shadow on this world  
I saw God's shadow on this world  
I saw God's shadow on this world  
I saw God's shadow on this world  
I saw God's shadow on this world  
I saw God's shadow on this world  
I saw God's shadow on this world  
I saw God's shadow on this world  
I saw God's shadow on this world  
I saw God's shadow on this world
