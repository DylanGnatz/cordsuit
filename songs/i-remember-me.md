He almost walked into a wall  
Oh man she was a sight to see  
At the party down the hall  
He said "you are the highest apple in the tree"

Out the window in the harbour he saw a little ship  
The moon was worn just slightly on the right  
They slow-danced so the needle wouldn't skip  
And he held her till the room was filled with light  

I remember you and I remember me  
The sunshine walking inside you and the man you could see in me.  
So I remember me and I remember you  
So many beautiful days in a row now and the nights were perfect too  

Hand in hand down a water-slide in Chattanooga  
They did not hide from love you see  
A winter's plane flight to Aruba  
Where he threw a boombox into the sea.  
One day they were cutting flowers for something to do  
On the bank of the road 'neath the cottonwoods  
He turned to her to ask if she'd marry him  
When a runaway truck hit him where he stood.

So I remember you and I remember you  
And I remember you do-do-do-do-do  
And I remember me and I remember me  
A black hawk nailed to the sky and the tape hiss from the trees.  

Everybody said she needed to move on  
That he was all but lost so deep was his coma.  
When he finally came to, the girl he loved was long gone.  
She'd married a banker and moved to Oklahoma.  
He bought a little land with the money from the settlement  
And he even bought the truck that had hit him that day  
He touched the part where the metal was bent.  
And if you were there you would hear him say.

I remember her and I remember him  
I remember them and I remember then  
I'm just rememberin'  
I'm just rememberin'
