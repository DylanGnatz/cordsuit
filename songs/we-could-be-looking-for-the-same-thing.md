Way way out past where the sidewalks disappear  
And up through bright blue blocks of sky  
Where the days turn to weeks in the months the year  
And we're together, you and I.

We could be looking for the same thing,  
If you're looking for someone.  
We could belong to each other,  
If you're not seeing anyone.

I hope I don't come across as a coyote in your eyes  
But I've been around some and I've seen  
Enough to know we could both spend happy lives  
Inside the days of you and me.

We could be looking for the same thing,  
If you're looking for someone.  
We could belong to each other,  
If you're not seeing anyone.
