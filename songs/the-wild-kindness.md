I wrote a letter to a wildflower  
on a classic nitrogen afternoon  
Some power that hardly looked like power  
said I'm perfect in an empty room

Four dogs in the distance  
each stands for a kindness, yeah  
Bluebirds lodged in an evergreen altar  
I'm gonna shine out in the wild silence  
and spurn the sin of giving in

Oil paintings of x-rated picnics  
Behind the walls of medication I'm free  
Every leaf in a compact mirror (bye, bye, goodbye, bye)  
hits a target that we can't see (goodbye, bye, goodbye) Grass grows in the icebox  
The year ends in the next room  
It is autumn and my camouflage is dying  
instead of time there will be lateness  
and let forever be delayed I dyed my hair in a motel void  
met the coroner at the Dreamgate Frontier  
He took may hand said I'll help you boy (bye, bye, goodbye, bye)  
if you really want to disappear (goodbye, bye, goodbye)Four dogs in the distance  
each stands for a silence  
Bluebirds lodged in an evergreen altar  
I'm gonna shine out in the wild kindness  
and hold the world to its word
