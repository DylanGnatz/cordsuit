Send in the clouds. Bring down the rain.  
Shut all the blinds, turn out the lights:  
I feel insane when you get in my bed. I am the trick my mother played on the world  
Seventeen doctors couldn't decide  
whether I should be allowed in the game. Why can't monsters get along with other monsters?  
Soi disantra, soi disantra. I know a puppy who walked from Kentucky.  
Made to East Virginia by dawn.  
He had seventeen ideas in his head. Windex tears flow down the robot's face.  
He's never felt a lover's embrace.  
My momma named me after a king.  
I'm gonna bury my name in you. Why can't monsters get along with other monsters?  
Soi disantra, soi disantra.
