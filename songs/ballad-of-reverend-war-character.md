Miss Mary Jane measures rain in a cracked cup on the sill  
In Embry's last photograph he disappears over a hill  
Darrell Dotson waits in the grass for a fight  
the stars don't shine upon us  
we're in the way of their light The new girl in Tahoe has swallowed Sinatra's cum  
A Russian primadonna dances slow on valium  
After the game the benchwarmer can't get a ride  
in space there is no center  
we're always off to the side John Parker III steps over a bird on a Wall St. window ledge  
Little Wilkie finds a dead cat rotting deep inside the hedge  
Mahalia Roach dies on a Greyhound coach in July  
in a horror movie when the car won't start  
you give it one last try Guinnevere orders one more beer in the smokey pick-up bar  
A burnt out tramp by the exit ramp waits for one more car  
The Latin teacher always smelled like piss  
the census figures come out wrong  
there's an extra in our midst
