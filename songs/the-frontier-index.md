Of all the people I knew  
I always looked up to you  
and after millions of years of crime  
the sun still shines and shines Look a horse (of course) gallops thru the desert light  
I make such good time through sub-space  
when I dream all day and ride all night A robot walks into a bar  
orders a drink  
lays down a bill  
The bartender says, hey we don't serve robots  
and the robot says, oh but someday you will Prison's a good time for some  
many people get caught with a gun  
This trucker says it's good to be free  
says he knows lots of folks who agree Bumperstickers talk to him  
say "let the stars get in your eyes"  
Time, cum, sand, and surf  
these are the building, building blocks of life Boy wants a car from his Dad  
Dad says, first you gotta cut that hair  
Boy says, hey Dad Jesus had long hair  
and Dad says  
that's right son, Jesus walked everywhere When I was younger I was a cobra  
in every case I wanted to be cool  
Now that I'm older and sub-space is colder  
I just want to say something true
