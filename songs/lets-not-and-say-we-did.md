Let's go hunting blackbirds, let's throw snowballs from the bridge  
The fireplace burns backwards, let's not and say we did.  
There's a trapdoor in the country where we can disappear.  
These giant evergreens are a promise redeemed  
Let's walk down the glassy top of a frozen pasture stream  
Our minds can dream like soda machines  
And that's exactly what we did.

Let's ride down the ridge to the military bridge  
You can't be against forever, let's not and say we did.  
There's a party in the country, where we can disappear.  
Dig if you will, a picture of you girl  
Finding the fiercest way to live  
We can ride all day in a one horse open sleigh  
And that's exactly what we did.  
And that's exactly what we did.
