Like like the the the death  
Air crickets air crickets air crickets air crickets air Mother and child with magazine  
Into a story, into a dream  
Why is there something instead of nothing  
And how is the asking built into the hunting? Do you believe in MGM endings  
Everybody's coming back to Xmas for Texas  
Folks who've watched their mother kill an animal know  
That their home is surrounded by places to go  
(and the west has made a deal with the sun). My life at home every day:  
Drinking Coke in a kitchen with a dog  
Who doesn't even know his name.  
Oh right it could've been anyone  
Grass rabbits grass rabbits grass rabbits grass rabbits grass Nobody cares about a dead hooker  
Looking like one, standing for many  
Life finds a limit at the edge of our bodies  
A stranger begins wherever I see 'em. Let's live where the indoors and outdoors meet  
All the kids in the commonwealth are free.  
Every morning you forgive me, every evening you relive me  
And the pattern itself is what you give me  
(the morning has cut a deal with the east). Like like the the the death  
Air crickets air crickets air crickets air crickets air
