Baby let's get dressed up  
I got two pairs of shoes  
Darling you look so beautiful  
when your hair's all hung in jewels  
and sometimes I find it really hard to choose  
between a pair of black and a pair of brown shoes When I'm high on batwings  
up by the silvery moon  
I think of a certain sad eyed king  
trapped in his golden room  
and I dream of a cold river on the way  
to come and sweep that king into this black and brown bay Well the water looks like jewelry  
when it's coming out the spout  
and nothing could make me feel better  
than a wet kiss on the mouth  
Fake I.D.'s and honeybees  
the jagged skyline of car keys  
I never knew the bird could fly so low Rub out the catlight,  
rub out the village  
red and white exit light  
that's exodus damage  
Why don't people think of who they use?  
Why don't you try and come and get me:  
Black and Brown Blues It's raining triple sec in Tchula  
and the radio plays "Crazy Train"  
there's a quadroon ball in the beehive  
hanging out in the rain  
and when there's trouble I dont like running  
but I'm afraid I got more in common  
with who I was than who I am becoming When I go downtown  
I always wear a corduroy suit  
cause it's made of a hundred gutters  
that the rain can run right through  
but a lonely man can't make a move  
if he can't even bring himself to choose  
between a pair of black and a pair of brown shoes
