The sun and the shutters and the sun shattered hair.  
The butler hesitates at the top of the stairs.  
A kitten from Great Britain sleeps behind the drapes.  
An old silver bowl filled with apples and grapes.

It's so very cold in the mansion after sunset  
Snow is blowing through the baseboard outlets.  
And I have no idea what drives you mister.  
tanning beds explode with rich women inside.

All my poor hungry children x3  
Time will break the world x3The snow falls down so beautiful and stupid  
Fore the black silhouette of Abraham Lincoln trees  
The sky is low and gray like a Japanese table.  
And my horse's legs look like four brown shotguns

The icicles are dripping like the whole house is weeping  
On an evil little car with gull-wing doors.  
And I have no idea what drives you mister  
But I've killed you in my mind so many times before.

All my poor hungry children x3  
Time will break the world x3
