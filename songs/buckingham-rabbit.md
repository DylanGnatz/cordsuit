Back then I had a Buckingham rabbit.  
I'd been lonely since she found Christ.  
Now is the time to depend on the law:  
the nights of my professional life,  
the nights of my professional life.

I was living in a very young city.  
Grand piano, great lakes, good-bye.  
If you ask me my name, it's high-low-jack in the game.  
I can track a single bee to the hive. Every single game was a blowout.  
And the Nascar blurred into porn.  
Scenic this, scenic that,  
don't fall for the traps of the man who was never born,  
of the man who was never born.so the rent became whiskey,  
and then my life became risky:  
and so the rent became whiskey, whiskey  
shattered dogs on the rocks. At the back of the bar there's a couch  
where the lonely people go and lie.  
They talk to the honky tonk psychiatrist  
into the wee hours of the night,  
into the wee hours of the night. The factories on muscle relaxers.  
The pine perfume of hilltown floors.  
The lover, the thinker, the talker, the singer  
won't be lucid for her anymore,  
won't be lucid for her anymore. so the rent became whiskey,  
and then my life became risky:  
and so the rent became whiskey, whiskey  
shattered dogs on the rocks.  
shattered dogs on the rocks. When you know how I feel I feel better  
When you're 15 you wanna look poor.  
You do unto others, and run like a mother  
I don't wanna look poor anymore,  
No I don't wanna look poor anymore.

Jesus in a runaway shelter,  
said "The deaf have pictures of you. "  
From the digital fountains to the analog mountains,  
let the mirror express the room,  
let the mirror express the room.
