where does an animal sleep when the ground is wet?  
cows in the ballroom, chickens in the farmer's corvette.sometimes a pony, sometimes a pony, sometimes a pony  
gets depressed.how does an animal see once the sun has set?  
bandits in the capital. limited civilian unrest.sometimes a pony, sometimes a pony, sometimes a pony  
gets depressed.what kind of animal needs to smoke a cigarette?  
grass in the pasture is sharper than a bayonet.sometimes a pony, sometimes a pony, sometimes a pony  
gets depressed. "happiness won't leave me alone! " sings the bird in his nest.  
"get a load of this fucking view, its the best in the west! "sometimes a pony, sometimes a pony, sometimes a pony  
gets depressed.
