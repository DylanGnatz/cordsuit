I wish I lived in the Power and the Light  
I wish it wasn't Saturday night  
Cause I can't raise hell,  
no I can't raise hell for two.

I wish I had a thousand bucks  
I wish I was the Royal Trux  
But mostly I wish, I wish I was with you.

When I was summoned to the phone  
I knew in my bones that you had died alone.

We've never been promised there will be a tomorrow  
So let's just call it "the death of an heir of sorrows"  
The death of an heir of sorrows.

I have not avoided certainty  
It has always just eluded me  
I wish I knew I wish I knew for true.

I wish I had a rhinestone suit  
I wish I had a new pair of boots  
But mostly I wish, I wish I was with you.

We've never been promised there will be a tomorrow  
So let's just call it "the death of an heir of sorrows"  
The death of an heir of sorrows.
