Up the hill past 694, at the stone wall make a left,  
and I will see you soon my friend if these old directions still direct.  
Is the problem that we can't see or is it that the problem is beautiful to me?  
The birds of Virginia are flying within you  
and like background singers they all come in threes. Won't soul music change  
now that our souls have turned strange.  
Once a day, twice a day  
And when on and off collide  
we'll set our souls aside and walk away. We've been raised on replicas of fake and winding roads  
and day after day up on this beautiful stage  
we've been playing tambourine for minimum wage  
but we are real, I know we are real. Repair is the dream of the broken thing  
Like a message broadcast on an overpass  
all my favorite singers couldn't sing.

My ski vest has buttons like convenience store mirrors  
and they help me see, that everything in this room right now is a part of me. Won't soul music change  
now that our souls have turned strange.  
Once a day, twice a day  
And when on and off collide  
we'll set our souls aside and walk away. Realizing is how it feels inside when it happens to you.  
So I took a shot of sugar like snow dumped into the blood  
and children wander off into the ultra-economic  
but we are real I know we are real.
