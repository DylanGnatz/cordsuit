I'm drunk on a couch in Nashville  
in a duplex near the reservoir  
and every single thought feels like a punch in the face  
I'm like a rabbit freezing on a star

On the wrong side of Sunday morning  
shattered in the terrible light  
working for a bankrupt circus  
on the wrong side of Saturday night

And I wanna be like water if I can  
cause water doesn't give a damn

Chased by a floating hatchet  
you can't just shoot your way out and go  
I can tell you things about this wallpaper  
that you'd never ever wanna know

There's an altar in the valley  
for things in themselves as they are  
and the triumph of the obstacles  
and horseleg swastikas

I wanna take a ride on the back of a sunbird  
up into the highest number
