I've been living in a k-hole.  
I've been living in a k-hole.  
ever since you went away.  
I've been down here day after day.I'd rather live in a trash can  
than see you happy with another man.  
closed sign swinging in the window of the liquor store.  
better get inside the kingdom and close the door.andre was a young black santa claus.  
he didn't want to be like his daddy was.  
better take the gun with you when you go.  
he'd rather be dead than anything he knows.girl in the special economic zone.  
girl in the special economic zone.  
closed sign swinging in the window of the liquor store.  
better get inside the kingdom and close the door.Â© D.C.
