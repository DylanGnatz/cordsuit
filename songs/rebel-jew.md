In the times I dream of Jesus  
it's like he's coming through the walls  
when I'm working at my desk at night  
I hear his footsteps in the hall you can believe me not believe me  
I'm just a bird upon the sill  
and these words just course right through me  
like water through a mill he was a rebel jew  
he was a rebel jew  
and he died for you and your sins  
he was a rebel jew  
he was a rebel jew  
let him in sometimes I dream of Texas  
yeah, it's the biggest part of me  
and the planes look like the sea at night  
oh, she wants to be so free she is a rebel state  
she is a rebel state  
and it's not too late for her to break  
from a sick, sick union  
an unhealed wound and separate all the time I dream of Michele  
and the towers in her mind  
some women lie down with killers  
oh, my baby's not that kind she is a real good girl  
yeah, she's a real good girl  
and she stops the world so I can't see  
that she's a good, good girl  
a good, good girl to me
