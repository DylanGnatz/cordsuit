Self Portrait at 28
===================

_By David Berman_

I
-

I know it's a bad title  
but I'm giving it to myself as a gift  
on a day nearly canceled by sunlight  
when the entire hill is approaching  
the ideal of Virginia  
brochured with goldenrod and loblolly  
and I think "at least I have not woken up  
with a bloody knife in my hand"  
by then having absently wandered  
one hundred yards from the house  
while still seated in this chair  
with my eyes closed.It is a certain hill  
the one I imagine when I hear the word "hill"  
and if the apocalypse turns out  
to be a world-wide nervous breakdown  
if our five billion minds collapse at once  
well I'd call that a surprise ending  
and this hill would still be beautiful  
a place I wouldn't mind dying  
alone or with you.I am trying to get at something  
and I want to talk very plainly to you  
so that we are both comforted by the honesty.  
You see there is a window by my desk  
I stare out when I am stuck  
though the outdoors has rarely inspired me to write  
and I don't know why I keep staring at it.  
My childhood hasn't made good material either  
mostly being a mulch of white minutes  
with a few stand out moments,  
popping tar bubbles on the driveway in the summer  
a certain amount of pride at school  
everytime they called it "our sun"  
and playing football when the only play  
was "go out long" are what stand out now.  
If squeezed for more information  
I can remember old clock radios  
with flipping metal numbers  
and an entree called Surf and Turf.  
As a way of getting in touch with my origins  
every night I set the alarm clock  
for the time I was born so that waking up  
becomes a historical reenactment  
and the first thing I do  
is take a reading of the day  
and try to flow with it  
like when you're riding a mechanical bull  
and you strain to learn the pattern quickly  
so you don't inadvertently resist it.

I can't remember being born  
and no one else can remember it either  
even the doctor who I met years later  
at a cocktail party.  
It's one of the little disappointments  
that makes you think about getting away  
going to Holly Springs or Coral Gables  
and taking a room on the square  
with a landlady whose hands are scored  
by disinfectant, telling the people you meet  
that you are from Alaska, and listen  
to what they have to say about Alaska  
until you have learned much more about Alaska  
than you ever will about Holly Springs or Coral Gables.   
Sometimes I am buying a newspaper  
in a strange city and think  
"I am about to learn what it's like to live here."  
Oftentimes there is a news item  
about the complaints of homeowners  
who live beside the airport  
and I realize that I read an article  
on this subject nearly once a year  
and always receive the same image.  
I am in bed late at night  
in my house near the airport  
listening to the jets fly overhead  
a strange wife sleeping beside me.  
In my mind, the bedroom is an amalgamation  
of various cold medicine commercial sets  
(there is always a box of tissue on the nightstand).   
I know these recurring news articles are clues,    
flaws in the design though I haven't figured out  
how to string them together yet,  
but I've begun to notice that the same people  
are dying over and over again,  
for instance Minnie Pearl  
who died this year  
for the fourth time in four years.

Today is the first day of Lent  
and once again I'm not really sure what it is.  
How many more years will I let pass  
before I take the trouble to ask someone?  
It reminds of this morning  
when you were getting ready for work.  
I was sitting by the space heater  
numbly watching you dress  
and when you asked why I never wear a robe  
I had so many good reasons  
I didn't know where to begin.  
If you were cool in high school  
you didn't ask too many questions.  
You could tell who'd been to last night's  
big metal concert by the new t-shirts in the hallway.  
You didn't have to ask  
and that's what cool was:  
the ability to deduct  
to know without asking.  
And the pressure to simulate coolness  
means not asking when you don't know,  
which is why kids grow ever more stupid.  
A yearbook's endpages, filled with promises  
to stay in touch, stand as proof of the uselessness  
of a teenager's promise. Not like I'm dying  
for a letter from the class stoner  
ten years on but... Do you remember the way the girls  
would call out "love you!"  
conveniently leaving out the "I"  
as if they didn't want to commit  
to their own declarations.  
I agree that the "I" is a pretty heavy concept  
and hope you won't get uncomfortable  
if I should go into some deeper stuff here.

There are things I've given up on    
like recording funny answering machine messages.  
It's part of growing older  
and the human race as a group  
has matured along the same lines.  
It seems our comedy dates the quickest.  
If you laugh out loud at Shakespeare's jokes  
I hope you won't be insulted   
if I say you're trying too hard.  
Even sketches from the original Saturday Night Live  
seem slow-witted and obvious now.  
It's just that our advances are irrepressible.  
Nowadays little kids can't even set up lemonade stands.  
It makes people too self-conscious about the past,  
though try explaining that to a kid.   
I'm not saying it should be this way.  
All this new technology  
will eventually give us new feelings  
that will never completely displace the old ones  
leaving everyone feeling quite nervous  
and split in two. We will travel to Mars  
even as folks on Earth  
are still ripping open potato chip  
bags with their teeth. Why?  
I don't have the time or intelligence  
to make all the connections  
like my friend Gordon  
(this is a true story  
who grew up in Braintree Massachusetts  
and had never pictured a brain snagged in a tree  
until I brought it up.  
He'd never broken the name down to its parts.  
By then it was too late.  
He had moved to Coral Gables.

The hill out my window is still looking beautiful  
suffused in a kind of gold national park light  
and it seems to say,  
I'm sorry the world could not possibly  
use another poem about Orpheus  
but I'm available if you're not working  
on a self-portrait or anything. I'm watching my dog have nightmares,  
twitching and whining on the office floor  
and I try to imagine what beast  
has cornered him in the meadow  
where his dreams are set. I'm just letting the day be what it is:  
a place for a large number of things  
to gather and interact --  
not even a place but an occasion  
a reality for real things. Friends warned me not to get too psychedelic  
or religious with this piece:  
"They won't accept it if it's too psychedelic  
or religious," but these are valid topics  
and I'm the one with the dog twitching on the floor  
possibly dreaming of me  
that part of me that would beat a dog  
for no good reason  
no reason that a dog could see.  
I am trying to get at something so simple  
that I have to talk plainly    
so the words don't disfigure it  
and if it turns out that what I say is untrue  
then at least let it be harmless  
like a leaky boat in the reeds  
that is bothering no one.

I can't trust the accuracy of my own memories,  
many of them having blended with sentimental  
telephone and margarine commercials  
plainly ruined by Madison Avenue  
though no one seems to call the advertising world  
"Madison Avenue" anymore. Have they moved?  
Let's get an update on this.  
But first I have some business to take care of.   
I walked out to the hill behind our house  
which looks positively Alaskan today  
and it would be easier to explain this if I had a picture to show you  
but I was with our young dog  
and he was running through the tall grass  
like running through the tall grass  
is all of life together  
until a bird calls or he finds a beer can  
and that thing fills all the space in his head. You see,    
his mind can only hold one thought at a time  
and when he finally hears me call his name  
he looks up and cocks his head  
and for a single moment  
my voice is everything: Self-portrait at 28.
