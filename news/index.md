It will be shown on March 12 at midnight.They are hopefully going to play a \"Sleeping is the Only Love\" video that Brent Stewart (the fellow who made the \"How Can I Love You\" video) shot yesterday and edited last night, continuing to make a big name for himself in the under 100 dollar MTV-worthy video world.

Silver Jews in Scotland
-----------------------

Following much speculation, we're delighted to confirm that skewed rock idols The Silver Jews will play their first-ever Scottish dates at this year's Triptych festival. They play Edinburgh's Bongo Club on Thursday April 27 and Glasgow's Tramway on Friday April 28. A London gig also takes place on Tuesday April 25.Performing live for the very first time in a celebrated fifteen-year career, enigmatic versifier David Berman and his endlessly erudite Silver Jews are finally set to gratify ears and enliven hearts with a clutch of inaugural Stateside shows in March; before crossing the water to woo Triptych aficionados and music lovers with their heady, hazy, hairy, grace.
