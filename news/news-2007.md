# The Silver Jew v. The Crash Test Dummy

 (http://www.quickmuse.com QuickMuse) is a Boston-based website about writing and improvisation. Two poets are assigned a topic and they make up some on-the-spot verse. Then readers hit the "playback" button and watch the poems unfurl, letter by letter.  The first singer-songwriter event on QuickMuse will feature the Silver Jews' David Berman and Brad Roberts, of The Crash Test Dummies. - 26th May 2007
