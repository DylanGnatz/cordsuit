## Actual Air Hardback

From http://www.dragcity.com: When you get tired of listening to CDs and outgrow wearing baseball caps (it'll happen someday, little Charlie), check out the Book Nook. That's where copies of the limited hardcover edition of David Berman's Actual Air can be found. We've placed them in shops around the globe and are offering what we have left to you, the mailorder customer. Priced to move at $28 (list price is $36!), this a great opportunity for you to buy the several extra copies to give away to friends and potential lovers around the high holidays. Shy a gift? Time to book it.
