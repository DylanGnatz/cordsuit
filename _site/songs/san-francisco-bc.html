<h1>San Francisco B.C.</h1>





<p>Old San Francisco, San Francisco B.C.<br />I lived with my true love and she lived with me.<br />&#8220;Romance is the douche of the bourgeoisie&#8221;<br />Was the very first thing she imparted to me<br />We had sarcastic hair, we used lewd pseudonyms<br />We got a lot of stares on the street back then.</p>

<p>Since her dad, a local barber, had been beaten to death<br />She had become a vocal martyr in the vegan press<br />The cops had failed, they couldn&#8217;t catch a bus<br />They were looking for a male with a bad hair cut<br />Enter tumbleweed, exit love and our affaire d&#8217;amour<br />Was set on self-destruct.</p>

<p>She said &#8220;you don&#8217;t make enough to provide for me. &#8221;<br />I said &#8220;what about the stuff that we quote believe? &#8221;<br />She said &#8220;I left that on the sands of history<br />I&#8217;ve found a new man to take care of me<br />He dresses for success and emergency<br />And he moves a lot of concrete on the QVC. &#8220;Little, asian, deadly, like a cobra in the shade<br />Sat in the midst of the smoke that he made<br />His name was Mr. Games and he owned the place<br />It was a lonely bar and grill in the Lower Haight<br />He had a jeweler&#8217;s hands and a blurry face<br />He knew I needed a chance so he gave me a break. &#8220;If I hire you now, can you start today?<br />I got a high-rise job down by the bay.<br />Just a couple of rocks and some firearms<br />There&#8217;s not many locks and just one alarm<br />My step-son Gene will pick you up and drive<br />Try to be his friend, he&#8217;s got a friendly side. &#8220;Doll-house lightning and the next thing I knew<br />We were back at our point of rendezvous.<br />I was in the possession of burglary tools<br />Children&#8217;s fur coats and diamonds and jewels<br />Gene&#8217;s talking about insignificant shit<br />Just like crooks in the movies when they do that bit.</p>

<p>He said the power of metal will never be harnessed.<br />I thought the wages of metal should be heavily garnished.<br />We were waiting for his dad to meet us there<br />Gene took off his hat and I noticed his hair<br />It was neatly trimmed but a patch was bare<br />I knew it wasn&#8217;t the wave, it was human error.</p>

<p>Before I knew what I said, I said &#8220;killer cut. &#8221;<br />I watched him silently putting out a cigarette butt.<br />Then he came at me with some fist cuisine<br />I had to duck aside and that was bad for Gene<br />Cause when he went by me he tripped and fell<br />Through the glass coffee table at the Wong hotel.</p>

<p>Right there and then Mr. Games walked in<br />With my ex-true love on his gamy limb.<br />So her dad&#8217;s killer&#8217;s dad was her new beau<br />And Games had a wife, whatta you know?<br />She got real real quiet till we chucked the kid<br />Then she went her way and I went his.</p>
