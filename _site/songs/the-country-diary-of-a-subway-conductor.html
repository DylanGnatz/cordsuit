<h1>The Country Diary of a Subway Conductor</h1>





<p>&#8220;O get him out of there! &#8221; What if it cost 25c<br />to wake up in the morning? A dollar, ten dollars?<br />I&#8217;d pay it all the way to the poor house. It&#8217;s not made<br />if it&#8217;s made in Roanoke. Night pulling up in front of<br />the house like a bus. It came at me with shears. Her<br />sweater had faces, famous faces knitted all over it.<br />The porch swing ticked off Central Daylight time.<br />&#8220;How many hours do you think it&#8217;ll take me to smoke this<br />cigarette? &#8221; she said with a smile. The smell of fried<br />food came drifting out one of the castle windows.<br />&#8220;Lets go around back&#8221; I said &#8220;my brother buried some<br />stuff back there. &#8221; We ducked down and walked through<br />the black bushes. My shoe made a sucking sound in<br />the turf. &#8220;He can afford anything&#8221; I said &#8220;he&#8217;s got<br />dogs that blow on trumpets. &#8221; &#8220;Priests! &#8221; she cussed.<br />Thunder cracks over Ben Franklin&#8217;s shop. Who wrapped<br />my dreams in a blanket and led them outside to the black<br />book in the yard? &#8220;Hey what indian tribe occupied<br />southern california? They were a lucky bunch of fellers! &#8221;<br />Sting Bible, More Sea Bible, Knur &amp; Spell. In moments<br />downhill, towards sleep in the stillwater shop. Imagining<br />places I was almost sure I&#8217;d never been &amp; had taken to<br />assuming were the memories of my grandfather somehow<br />deposited in my mind. They were there and gone, just before<br />I could get my bearings, catch any names or find out<br />where the hotel was. Just a pile of glass shavings that<br />could never be reassembled into the gone order<br />of buildings &amp; the shade pouring off of them. &#8220;WATER! &#8221;</p>
