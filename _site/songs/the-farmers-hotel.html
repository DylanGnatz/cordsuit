<h1>The Farmer's Hotel</h1>





<p>the lights went out in New York, then they went in Goshen.<br />I got stuck in Goshen and that was sad.<br />the townsfolk stared hard like their minds had been marred<br />by life in a district so downtrodden and drab.</p>

<p>I flagged down a stranger in a worn wooden wheelchair,<br />and when I asked if he knew of a hotel<br />he said &#8220;if I get your meaning, then I&#8217;m definitely leaning<br />towards recommending the Farmer&#8217;s Hotel. &#8220;as I left to find the place, a mother looked me in the face<br />and whispered &#8220;please sir, not the Farmer&#8217;s Hotel. &#8221;<br />once where I was headed, she swore I would regret it,<br />what might happen she wouldn&#8217;t foretell.the old place it was vicious, wicked and pernicious,<br />&#8220;please stay clear of that rank abattoir. &#8221;<br />though her words alarmed me, I was stuck until morning<br />and in the end we must be who we are.with no light on the door, I wasn&#8217;t quite sure<br />if a night clerk was working within.<br />from behind a red curtain limped a perilous person.<br />he appeared to have some egg on his chin.this old yankee warlock brushed back a gray forelock<br />and he motioned me to sign in the book.<br />with no bonhomie he proffered the key.<br />never once did he give me a look.</p>

<p>I thanked the old codger, and in my role as the lodger,<br />I headed upstairs for to sleep.<br />there was no air of slumber, the doors they had no numbers<br />which room was intended for me?the passage kept on going like the carpet was flowing<br />towards that thing at the end of the hall.<br />my own eyes had adjusted.<br />my account can be trusted,<br />cause I know that I saw what I saw.</p>

<p>I heard animal noises and tangled up voices<br />chanting more and of rumors of more.<br />there&#8217;s no natural law that can explain what I saw<br />spread out on that straw-covered floor.now I&#8217;ve put an ocean between myself and Goshen<br />to get away from the Farmer&#8217;s Hotel.<br />things so unclean, are better left unseen.<br />keep away from the Farmer&#8217;s Hotel.the lights went out in Goshen, just like poetry in motion,<br />and I checked into the Farmer&#8217;s Hotel.<br />so if you get a notion to travel to Goshen,<br />please stay away from the Farmer&#8217;s Hotel.Â© D.C.</p>
