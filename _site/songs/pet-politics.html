<h1>Pet Politics</h1>





<p>Guard my bed<br />while the rain turns the ditches to mirrors<br />by a vase of carnations from central Ohio<br />where the looking machine can&#8217;t hear us Deep in the night we dream of positions<br />there&#8217;s a line for the phone in the hall<br />and in the cold places where Spanish is spoken<br />most wars end in the fall You never know when your pet will go<br />pet politics (x4) Still wearing last night&#8217;s mascara<br />now that her pet was gone for sure<br />she was shivering so hard<br />it looked like there were two of her I could see through the sleeve of her blouse<br />the plans of her architect lover<br />a tattoo of a boarded-up house<br />and ink door that belonged to another When the rain hits you<br />it hits you slow<br />stitch after stitch (x4) Adam was not the first man &#8216;though the Bible tells us so<br />There was one created before him, whose name we do not know<br />He also lived in the garden<br />but he had no mouth or eyes<br />One day Adam came to kill him<br />and he died beneath these skies I find it so amazing how<br />I go where I&#8217;m led (x4) I suspect we could be losing now<br />please guard my bed<br />please guard my bed<br />please guard my bed<br />please guard my bed</p>
