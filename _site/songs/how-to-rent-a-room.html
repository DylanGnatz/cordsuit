<h1>How to Rent a Room</h1>





<p>No I don&#8217;t really want to die<br />I only want to die in your eyes<br />I&#8217;m still here below the chandelier<br />where they always used to read us our rights I want to wander through the night<br />as a figure in the distance even to my own eye<br />Have you ever rented a room<br />have you even ever rented a room?An anchor lets you see the river move<br />but now that your evil dreams came true<br />there on your face<br />a row of teeth he&#8217;ll come to replace I know you laughed when I left<br />but you really only hurt yourself<br />When you see your curtains move in the wind<br />you can bet I&#8217;m betting against you again Cause I&#8217;m a man who has a wife who has a mother<br />who married one but she loved another<br />You&#8217;re a tower without the bells<br />you&#8217;re a negative wishing well I should have checked the stable door<br />for the name of the sire and dam<br />you were always at the dogtrack<br />with your brother and all his friends Chalk lines around my body<br />like the shoreline of a lake<br />Your laughter made me nervous<br />it made your body shake too hard Now there&#8217;s a lot of things that I&#8217;m gonna miss<br />like thunder down country and the way water drips<br />when you&#8217;re running for the door in the rain<br />read the metro section&#8230;see my name No I didn&#8217;t really want to die<br />I only wanted to die in your eyes<br />Grant me one last wish<br />Life should mean a lot less than this</p>
