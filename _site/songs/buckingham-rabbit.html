<h1>Buckingham Rabbit</h1>





<p>Back then I had a Buckingham rabbit.<br />I&#8217;d been lonely since she found Christ.<br />Now is the time to depend on the law:<br />the nights of my professional life,<br />the nights of my professional life.</p>

<p>I was living in a very young city.<br />Grand piano, great lakes, good-bye.<br />If you ask me my name, it&#8217;s high-low-jack in the game.<br />I can track a single bee to the hive. Every single game was a blowout.<br />And the Nascar blurred into porn.<br />Scenic this, scenic that,<br />don&#8217;t fall for the traps of the man who was never born,<br />of the man who was never born.so the rent became whiskey,<br />and then my life became risky:<br />and so the rent became whiskey, whiskey<br />shattered dogs on the rocks. At the back of the bar there&#8217;s a couch<br />where the lonely people go and lie.<br />They talk to the honky tonk psychiatrist<br />into the wee hours of the night,<br />into the wee hours of the night. The factories on muscle relaxers.<br />The pine perfume of hilltown floors.<br />The lover, the thinker, the talker, the singer<br />won&#8217;t be lucid for her anymore,<br />won&#8217;t be lucid for her anymore. so the rent became whiskey,<br />and then my life became risky:<br />and so the rent became whiskey, whiskey<br />shattered dogs on the rocks.<br />shattered dogs on the rocks. When you know how I feel I feel better<br />When you&#8217;re 15 you wanna look poor.<br />You do unto others, and run like a mother<br />I don&#8217;t wanna look poor anymore,<br />No I don&#8217;t wanna look poor anymore.</p>

<p>Jesus in a runaway shelter,<br />said &#8220;The deaf have pictures of you. &#8221;<br />From the digital fountains to the analog mountains,<br />let the mirror express the room,<br />let the mirror express the room.</p>
