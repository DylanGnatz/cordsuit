<h1>I Remember Me</h1>





<p>He almost walked into a wall<br />Oh man she was a sight to see<br />At the party down the hall<br />He said &#8220;you are the highest apple in the tree&#8221;<br />Out the window in the harbour he saw a little ship<br />The moon was worn just slightly on the right<br />They slowdanced so the needle wouldn&#8217;t skip<br />And he held her till the room was filled with light</p>

<p>I remember you and I remember me<br />The sunshine walking inside you/and the man you could see in me.<br />So I remember me and I remember you<br />So many beautiful days in a row now and the nights were perfect too</p>

<p>Hand in hand down a waterslide in Chattanooga<br />They did not hide from love you see<br />A winter&#8217;s plane flight to Aruba<br />Where he threw a boombox into the sea.<br />One day they were cutting flowers for something to do<br />On the bank of the road &#8216;neath the cottonwoods<br />He turned to her to ask if she&#8217;d marry him<br />When a runnaway truck hit him where he stood.</p>

<p>So I remember you and I remember you<br />And I remember you do-do-do-do-do<br />And I remember me and I remember me<br />A blackhalk nailed to the sky/and the tape hiss from the trees.</p>

<p>Everybody said she needed to move on<br />That he was all but lost so deep was his coma.<br />When he finally came to, the girl he loved was long gone.<br />She&#8217;d married a banker and moved to Oklahoma.<br />He bought a little land with the money from the settlement<br />And he even bought the truck that had hit him that day<br />He touched the part where the metal was bent.<br />And if you were there you would hear him say.</p>

<p>I remember her and I remember him<br />I remember them and I remember then..<br />I&#8217;m just rememberin&#8217; I&#8217;m just rememberin&#8217;</p>
