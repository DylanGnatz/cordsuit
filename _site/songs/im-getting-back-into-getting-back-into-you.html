<h1>I'm Getting Back Into Getting Back Into You</h1>





<p>Baby won&#8217;t you take this magnet and maybe put my picture back on the fridge.<br />I must have been crazy, to let you get away like you did.<br />And like a brown bird nesting in a Texaco sign I got a point of view,<br />And the kicker is that, I&#8217;m getting back in getting back into you.</p>

<p>I guess over time we became ducks, I never seemed to see you much.<br />Then the world turned, time got away, we fell out of touch.<br />I&#8217;ve been working at the airport bar, it&#8217;s like Christmas in a submarine.<br />Wings and brandy on a Winter&#8217;s night: I guess you wouldn&#8217;t call it a scene.</p>

<p>Now my ex-wife&#8217;s living in the suburbs with her guru and her mom.<br />Now she finds her consolation in the stardust of a bong.<br />You can call it a spinoff, say it&#8217;s a knockoff, title it part two.<br />But I&#8217;m getting back into getting back into getting back into you.<br />I&#8217;m getting back into getting back into getting back into you.</p>
