<h1>Random Rules</h1>





<p>In 1984 I was hospitalized for approaching perfection.<br />Slowly screwing my way across Europe, they had to make a correction.<br />Broken and smokin&#8217; where the infrared deer plunge in the digital snake.<br />I tell you, they make it so you can&#8217;t shake hands when they make your hands shake. I know you like to line dance, everything so democratic and cool,<br />But baby there&#8217;s no guidance when random rules. I know that a lot of what I say has been lifted off of men&#8217;s room walls.<br />Maybe I&#8217;ve crossed the wrong rivers and walked down all the wrong halls.<br />But nothing can change the fact that we used to share a bed<br />and that&#8217;s why it scared me so when you turned to me and said: &#8220;Yeah, you look like someone<br />Yeah you look like someone who up and left me low.<br />Boy, you look like somene I used to know. &#8221; I asked the painter why the roads are colored black.<br />He said, &#8220;Steve, it&#8217;s because people leave<br />and no highway will bring them back. &#8221;<br />So if you don&#8217;t want me I promise not to linger,<br />But before I go I gotta ask you dear about the tan line on your ring finger. No one should have two lives,<br />now you know my middle names are wrong and right.<br />Honey we&#8217;ve got two lives to give tonight.</p>
