<p>GMonday in Ft. Lauderdale</p>

<p>GI came all this way to see your grave</p>

<p>EmTo see your life as written paraphrased</p>

<p>Jelly beans and cookie dough</p>

<p>Country restroom on a radio</p>

<p>I got a number on my name</p>

<p>It’s hard to rise above the shame</p>

<p>I’m a branded man made in the mold.</p>

<p>These terms engulf the waking mind.</p>

<p>Like cherry, grape and lemon-limeLike candy corn and licoriceLike bubble gum and Swedish fish</p>

<p>It happens to me all the time.</p>

<p>Living in a candy jail</p>

<p>With peppermint bars</p>

<p>Peanut brittle bunk beds</p>

<p>And marshmallow walls.</p>

<p>Where the guards are graciousAnd the grounds are grand</p>

<p>And the warden really listens</p>

<p>And he understands.</p>
