<h1>Self Portrait at 28</h1>

<h2 id='i'>I</h2>

<p>I know it&#8217;s a bad title<br />but I&#8217;m giving it to myself as a gift<br />on a day nearly canceled by sunlight<br />when the entire hill is approaching<br />the ideal of Virginia<br />brochured with goldenrod and loblolly<br />and I think &#8220;at least I have not woken up<br />with a bloody knife in my hand&#8221;<br />by then having absently wandered<br />one hundred yards from the house<br />while still seated in this chair<br />with my eyes closed. It is a certain hill<br />the one I imagine when I hear the word &#8220;hill&#8221;<br />and if the apocalypse turns out<br />to be a world-wide nervous breakdown<br />if our five billion minds collapse at once<br />well I&#8217;d call that a surprise ending<br />and this hill would still be beautiful<br />a place I wouldn&#8217;t mind dying<br />alone or with you. I am trying to get at something<br />and I want to talk very plainly to you<br />so that we are both comforted by the honesty.<br />You see there is a window by my desk<br />I stare out when I am stuck<br />though the outdoors has rarely inspired me to write<br />and I don&#8217;t know why I keep staring at it.<br />My childhood hasn&#8217;t made good material either<br />mostly being a mulch of white minutes<br />with a few stand out moments,<br />popping tar bubbles on the driveway in the summer<br />a certain amount of pride at school<br />everytime they called it &#8220;our sun&#8221;<br />and playing football when the only play<br />was &#8220;go out long&#8221; are what stand out now.<br />If squeezed for more information<br />I can remember old clock radios<br />with flipping metal numbers<br />and an entree called Surf and Turf.<br />As a way of getting in touch with my origins<br />every night I set the alarm clock<br />for the time I was born so that waking up<br />becomes a historical reenactment<br />and the first thing I do<br />is take a reading of the day<br />and try to flow with it<br />like when you&#8217;re riding a mechanical bull<br />and you strain to learn the pattern quickly<br />so you don&#8217;t inadvertently resist it.</p>

<h2 id='ii'>II</h2>

<p>I can&#8217;t remember being born<br />and no one else can remember it either<br />even the doctor who I met years later<br />at a cocktail party.<br />It&#8217;s one of the little disappointments<br />that makes you think about getting away<br />going to Holly Springs or Coral Gables<br />and taking a room on the square<br />with a landlady whose hands are scored<br />by disinfectant, telling the people you meet<br />that you are from Alaska, and listen<br />to what they have to say about Alaska<br />until you have learned much more about Alaska<br />than you ever will about Holly Springs or Coral Gables.<br />Sometimes I am buying a newspaper<br />in a strange city and think<br />&#8220;I am about to learn what it&#8217;s like to live here. &#8221;<br />Oftentimes there is a news item<br />about the complaints of homeowners<br />who live beside the airport<br />and I realize that I read an article<br />on this subject nearly once a year<br />and always receive the same image. I am in bed late at night<br />in my house near the airport<br />listening to the jets fly overhead<br />a strange wife sleeping beside me.<br />In my mind, the bedroom is an amalgamation<br />of various cold medicine commercial sets<br />(there is always a box of tissue on the nightstand).<br />I know these recurring news articles are clues,<br />flaws in the design though I haven&#8217;t figured out<br />how to string them together yet,<br />but I&#8217;ve begun to notice that the same people<br />are dying over and over again,<br />for instance Minnie Pearl<br />who died this year<br />for the fourth time in four years.</p>

<h2 id='iii'>III</h2>

<p>Today is the first day of Lent<br />and once again I&#8217;m not really sure what it is.<br />How many more years will I let pass<br />before I take the trouble to ask someone?<br />It reminds of this morning<br />when you were getting ready for work.<br />I was sitting by the space heater<br />numbly watching you dress<br />and when you asked why I never wear a robe<br />I had so many good reasons<br />I didn&#8217;t know where to begin.<br />If you were cool in high school<br />you didn&#8217;t ask too many questions.<br />You could tell who&#8217;d been to last night&#8217;s<br />big metal concert by the new t-shirts in the hallway.<br />You didn&#8217;t have to ask<br />and that&#8217;s what cool was:<br />the ability to deduct<br />to know without asking.<br />And the pressure to simulate coolness<br />means not asking when you don&#8217;t know,<br />which is why kids grow ever more stupid.<br />A yearbook&#8217;s endpages, filled with promises<br />to stay in touch, stand as proof of the uselessness<br />of a teenager&#8217;s promise. Not like I&#8217;m dying<br />for a letter from the class stoner<br />ten years on but&#8230; Do you remember the way the girls<br />would call out &#8220;love you! &#8221;<br />conveniently leaving out the &#8220;I&#8221;<br />as if they didn&#8217;t want to commit<br />to their own declarations.<br />I agree that the &#8220;I&#8221; is a pretty heavy concept<br />and hope you won&#8217;t get uncomfortable<br />if I should go into some deeper stuff here.</p>

<h2 id='iv'>IV</h2>

<p>There are things I&#8217;ve given up on<br />like recording funny answering machine messages.<br />It&#8217;s part of growing older<br />and the human race as a group<br />has matured along the same lines.<br />It seems our comedy dates the quickest.<br />If you laugh out loud at Shakespeare&#8217;s jokes<br />I hope you won&#8217;t be insulted <br />if I say you&#8217;re trying too hard.<br />Even sketches from the original Saturday Night Live<br />seem slow-witted and obvious now.<br />It&#8217;s just that our advances are irrepressible.<br />Nowadays little kids can&#8217;t even set up lemonade stands.<br />It makes people too self-conscious about the past,<br />though try explaining that to a kid.<br />I&#8217;m not saying it should be this way. All this new technology<br />will eventually give us new feelings<br />that will never completely displace the old ones<br />leaving everyone feeling quite nervous<br />and split in two. We will travel to Mars<br />even as folks on Earth<br />are still ripping open potato chip<br />bags with their teeth. Why? I don&#8217;t have the time or intelligence<br />to make all the connections<br />like my friend Gordon<br />(this is a true story<br />who grew up in Braintree Massachusetts<br />and had never pictured a brain snagged in a tree<br />until I brought it up.<br />He&#8217;d never broken the name down to its parts.<br />By then it was too late.<br />He had moved to Coral Gables.</p>

<h2 id='v'>V</h2>

<p>The hill out my window is still looking beautiful<br />suffused in a kind of gold national park light<br />and it seems to say,<br />I&#8217;m sorry the world could not possibly<br />use another poem about Orpheus<br />but I&#8217;m available if you&#8217;re not working<br />on a self-portrait or anything.<br />I&#8217;m watching my dog have nightmares,<br />twitching and whining on the office floor<br />and I try to imagine what beast<br />has cornered him in the meadow<br />where his dreams are set.<br />I&#8217;m just letting the day be what it is:<br />a place for a large number of things<br />to gather and interact &#8211;<br />not even a place but an occasion<br />a reality for real things.<br />Friends warned me not to get too psychedelic<br />or religious with this piece:<br />&#8220;They won&#8217;t accept it if it&#8217;s too psychedelic<br />or religious,&#8221; but these are valid topics<br />and I&#8217;m the one with the dog twitching on the floor<br />possibly dreaming of me<br />that part of me that would beat a dog<br />for no good reason<br />no reason that a dog could see.<br />I am trying to get at something so simple<br />that I have to talk plainly<br />so the words don&#8217;t disfigure it<br />and if it turns out that what I say is untrue<br />then at least let it be harmless<br />like a leaky boat in the reeds<br />that is bothering no one.</p>

<h2 id='vi'>VI</h2>

<p>I can&#8217;t trust the accuracy of my own memories,<br />many of them having blended with sentimental<br />telephone and margarine commercials<br />plainly ruined by Madison Avenue<br />though no one seems to call the advertising world<br />&#8220;Madison Avenue&#8221; anymore. Have they moved?<br />Let&#8217;s get an update on this.<br />But first I have some business to take care of.<br />I walked out to the hill behind our house<br />which looks positively Alaskan today<br />and it would be easier to explain this if I had a picture to show you<br />but I was with our young dog<br />and he was running through the tall grass<br />like running through the tall grass<br />is all of life together<br />until a bird calls or he finds a beer can<br />and that thing fills all the space in his head. You see,<br />his mind can only hold one thought at a time<br />and when he finally hears me call his name<br />he looks up and cocks his head<br />and for a single moment<br />my voice is everything: Self-portrait at 28.</p>
