<p>&#8220;Were you happy with American Water?&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes. It lacked the tentativeness of so much music. I thought it was a man&#8217;s record. That the other two were written by a manchild.</p>

<p>&#8220;At any point did you feel it was the last Silver Jews album?&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes. I had lost interest in working in music. Partly, feeling sorry for myself that we didn&#8217;t get the respect we deserved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does being a poet help with songwriting or get in the way?&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s pretty much my only clear advantage point so i&#8217;ll say it helps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are any of your poems companions to songs?&#8221;</p>

<p>No, not that I&#8217;m aware of.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there still an &#8216;Actual Air&#8217; hardcover in the works?&#8221;</p>

<p>Supposedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;After a 3-year absence what brought you back to the Silver Jews?&#8221;</p>

<p>On Feb. 1st I decided I needed some income so i very methodically sat down in the dining room and five days a week for three hours a day I wrote the record.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bright Flight&#8217;, &#8220;What is the story behind the title?&#8221;</p>

<p>No story. Just when a plane breaks the clouds after takeoff and the sun is searing thru the cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;How big an influence did living in Nashville have in the feel of this album?&#8221;</p>

<p>Some. A lot. I don&#8217;t know. I do know I love living here and would like to stay here.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will there be any touring to support this album?&#8221;</p>

<p>Are fucking kidding me?</p>

<p>&#8220;How does the prospect of another Silver Jews album sound?&#8221;</p>

<p>Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I noticed you did some artwork for a national magazine recently, how did you land that job? And will we see more art from you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drag City wants to put out a book of drawings but fuck if I&#8217;m going to have everything written about me from now on use the term &#8220;renaissance man&#8221; I just wont have it!!</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the last good book you read?&#8221;</p>

<p>Richard Yates Collected short fiction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you follow contemporary music closely? What are your top 5 albums of this year?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8216;I hope you dance&#8217; Lee Ann Womack single<br />parts of U2 album<br />les savy fav<br />US Maple &#8216;acre thrills&#8217;<br />Jimmy Martin&#8217;s greatest hits</p>
