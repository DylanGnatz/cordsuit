<p><em>Hi there, introduce yourself and your band please?</em></p>

<p>Hello, I&#8217;m David, and this is the band: Peyton Pinkerton and William Tyler on guitar. Tony Crow, keyboards. Brian Kotzur: drums and my bass Cassie who plays wife.</p>

<p><em>Are the band you tour with the band you are now recording with?</em></p>

<p>Yes. I warmed them up for six months and then I let them rest a year. Next, I throw them in the studio with no time to prepare, then I disappear with the tapes and screen all their calls for 2-3 months.</p>

<p><em>The earlier Silver Jews songs sounded like rough ideas which were quickly recorded, was that the case?</em></p>

<p>That&#8217;s it. &#8216;Rough ideas. Quickly Recorded.&#8217;</p>

<p><em>By the time of the Natural Bridge all the songs were much more coherent and more &#8216;perfectly formed&#8217;, was there a turning point for you in terms of your song writing?</em></p>

<p>The turning point was likely the city of Hartford, CT where the album was recorded. I don&#8217;t want to tear down their city, but I think I was compelled to create these adjunct worlds to which I could flee to under stress.</p>

<p><em>When did you move to Nashville and do you think moving there changed your music at all?</em></p>

<ol>
<li>I think it helped me to decide that music could be a lifelong art. The rock precedence is not promising in that regard.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>When recording the songs for the Arizona record, what were your influences? I only ask this because the first time I heard Jackson Nightz I was listening to music on shuffle and I thought I was listening to some early Sebadoh record.</em></p>

<p>Well, definitely not Sebadoh! I&#8217;m sure both songs were influenced by the Daniel Johnston cassettes.</p>

<p><em>Have you ever considered re-recording any of the songs off the Arizona record? Secret Knowledge of Backroads and Jackson Nightz in particular stand out to me on this record.</em></p>

<p>I guess if I&#8217;m ever struggling for reasons to be relevant, you know touring &#8216;American Water&#8217;, etc. I might go lower.</p>

<p><em>What was the inspiration behind &#8216;I remember me&#8217;? Was it based on anything?</em></p>

<p>It was based on a fear I had about losing my bass player. Purposely a little purple, the song was supposed to scare me in to getting married by painting an awful loneliness.</p>

<p><em>When you felt low in what way did it affect your lyrics? Did you feel you became more reserved in what you wrote or did you find writing a way of expressing how you felt?</em></p>

<p>Any depressing writing I&#8217;ve done, was mostly done in &#8216;good times&#8217; looking back, mapping the contours of the bad times, delineating them, or extracting them via psychic surgery.</p>

<p><em>Prior to touring I understand the only kind of gigs you played would be a few songs at parties. Was this true and if so can you give an account of what these performances were like?</em></p>

<p>I got trapped into playing in a bar in Houston after it was closed. The owner had a guitar and when I said I didn&#8217;t remember the chords or the words to any of my songs, he ran upstairs to his apartment and brought down a three ring binder with guitar tabs for all four albums.</p>

<p><em>It has been 8 years since the publication of Actual Air, can we expect any more of your poetry to be published?</em></p>

<p>That is something I need to think about more.</p>

<p><em>With your writing, when you put pen to paper do you know what you&#8217;re going to write? Or can a lyric turn into a poem into a story?</em></p>

<p>If I make the decision to write something, it is to fulfil a need I have for a song or a poem. Someone needs a poem from me and I can&#8217;t politely put it off anymore. I need two more songs to make an album. Dreaming up the content is the second step.</p>

<p><em>I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if I learnt that you had written a novel, is this something you&#8217;d be interested in doing?</em></p>

<p>No, I think I prefer short forms. I don&#8217;t consider prose fiction to be relevant anymore, anyway.</p>
