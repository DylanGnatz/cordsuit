<p>Silver Jews leader David Berman, in town to give a poetry reading, sat straight-backed in the tiny Chinese eatery with nothing before him but a Corona that he had poured into a juice glass. It was an odd juxtaposition - not only the beer in the juice glass, but the Mexican beer in an Asian restaurant. But then, Berman lives and breathes such contradictions - at least in his poetry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the real unit of a poem is phrases,&#8221; said Berman, the singer, songwriter and guitarist whose first book of poetry, &#8220;Actual Air,&#8221; was published in June. &#8220;Most specifically, a noun modified by an adjective that you&#8217;ve never seen it modified with before. &#8221; Fans of Berman&#8217;s will recognize one such phrase in the Silver Jews&#8217; album title American Water. That 1998 disc included such songs as &#8220;Blue Arrangements&#8221; and &#8220;Random Rules&#8221;. &#8220;Once I was in school and a teacher said, &#8216;There aren&#8217;t any interesting verbs in (this poem). You always seek interesting object descriptions, but I guess you&#8217;re not interested in describing action in a new way,&#8217; &#8221; Berman, 32, recalled in a deep, gentle voice. &#8220;My poems are like miniatures. They&#8217;re real still. There&#8217;s not left hooks and speeding trains and stuff. They always seem boxed in. &#8220;That stillness pervades &#8220;Actual Air&#8221; even more thoroughly than Berman&#8217;s work with Silver Jews, a band whose revolving membership often includes Pavement singer Steve Malkmus. Snowfall sets the scene in several of the poems. &#8220;When it&#8217;s snowing, the outdoors seem like a room,&#8221; Berman writes in the opening piece, &#8220;Snow. &#8221; He maintains the intimacy but turns the image inside out in &#8220;If There Was a Book About This Hallway,&#8221; referring to a favorite passageway as &#8220;an outdoors that is somehow indoors. &#8221;&#8221;The Spine of the Snowman&#8221; plays again with incongruities, as an old caretaker explains to a robot that when snowmen melt, they sometimes reveal inner constructions, such as a gourd for an organ or a stick for a spine. &#8220;The robot shifted uncomfortably in his chair,&#8221; Berman writes, striking the reader with the disconcerting notion that some things are so odd as to make even a heartless being squirm.</p>

<p>During his 20-minute poetry reading at Barbara&#8217;s Bookstore in the Old Town neighborhood, Berman&#8217;s six-foot-three-inch frame loomed tall under a neon sign for the &#8220;Kid&#8217;s Books&#8221; section. He explained that references to middlebrow authors Isaac Asimov and James Michener in several of his poems are not meant as irony. &#8220;You get it wrong if you think it&#8217;s a joke - about so many things,&#8221; he told the audience of about 40 fans.</p>

<p>Earlier, smoking a cigarette outside the store, Berman said Silver Jews&#8217; three albums had provided enough income to subsidize a non-lucrative poetry career. He isn&#8217;t generally paid for readings such as this one, and he had to foot the airfare from his home in Nashville. Perhaps that&#8217;s why he looked unceremonious in an army-surplus shirt, with a five-o&#8217;clock shadow and unwashed, barely combed hair. Might as well be comfortable for a gig that&#8217;s not even paying.</p>

<p>Songwriting is not only more profitable but also typically easier than writing poetry, said Berman, who studied poetry at the University of Massachusetts. &#8220;If I write a song, I usually start out with the music and then write words to fit into those cadences. I can go anywhere when I sit down with a blank piece of paper (to write a poem). But the flip side of that freedom is there&#8217;s a lot more pressure. The limits of songwriting are actually very helpful. &#8220;Joe Williams, a 21-year-old fan, was first drawn to Berman&#8217;s work through Silver Jews&#8217; albums. He bought &#8220;Actual Air&#8221; when it was first published in June and drove six hours on Thursday from Ames, Iowa, to hear Berman read. &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of like audience-participation poetry, where you know what he means,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;In my own mind, there&#8217;s no doubt that I know what he&#8217;s saying or I know what he&#8217;s trying to convey. It makes it stick with you that much more. A lot of what he&#8217;s saying is relatable and straightforward enough that you really walk away feeling like he told you something. &#8221;</p>
