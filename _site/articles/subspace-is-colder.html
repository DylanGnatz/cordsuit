<p>Mention Albemarle County resident David Berman among indie rock cognoscenti and you&#8217;ll get instant recognition. But most people around here just say &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he that tall, cool guy? &#8220;The Silver Jews is Berman&#8217;s band, founded in 1990 when he shared a Hoboken apartment with Steve Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich, both erstwhile Charlottesvillians via UVA, and both better known as M.O.P.: Members of Pavement. Their music is pensive and tuneful, with no real pyrotechnics. It&#8217;s almost folksy: simple music about important things which inspires you to sing along.</p>

<p>Despite the differences from Pavement, the Silver Jews have been unfairly labeled a Pavement side project. That will change. The Jews&#8217; second full-length comes out today on Chicago&#8217;s ultra-hip label Drag City. Called &#8220;The Natural Bridge&#8221;, the album is chock full of Virginia references and Virginia moods, and the same gentle wit that made their first album, &#8220;Starlite Walker&#8221;, a quiet triumph among the in-the-know. &#8220;Bridge&#8221; spawned gossip long before it was recorded: after a week of practice in Charlottesville last October, the Silver Jews returned to the same studio in Memphis where they&#8217;d done &#8220;Starlite&#8221;. But something wasn&#8217;t quite right. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t feel like they were entering the songs the way I wanted them to,&#8221; Berman explains. And, knowing he was costing lots of people time, money and inconvenience, he scrapped the sessions.</p>

<p>Finally recorded in June at Studio .45 (an old Colt gun factory) in Hartford, Connecticut, &#8220;Bridge&#8221; features Peyton Pinkerton and Matt Hunter from New Radiant Storm King (with whom the Silver Jews released a split single in 1993), producer / drummer Rian Thomas Murphy, a Drag City fixture, and keyboardist Michael Deming. &#8220;I needed people who understood the Silver Jews,&#8221; Berman says, &#8220;but didn&#8217;t feel like they had to be in the band. &#8221; This line-up change took some feather-smoothing on Berman&#8217;s part, but he says that Malkmus and Nastanovich are still in the Silver Jews, and his next project will be with them.</p>

<p>Many of the &#8220;Bridge&#8221; songs were written last winter, says Berman, &#8220;when I was trapped in the house. All of them were written on cloudy days. &#8220;He made tapes of the songs and sent demos to the other musicians a couple weeks before meeting to record. &#8220;By the time we got to the studio,&#8221; says Berman, &#8220;they knew the songs better than I did. &#8220;He describes the two weeks of recordings as kind of hellish because he had severe insomnia, so severe that he was having walking hallucinations and being &#8220;constantly on the line with God,&#8221; praying to be able to sleep again.</p>

<p>One day driving to the studio, a tractor trailor truck from Guaranteed Overnight Delivery - G.O.D. - was parked perpendicular to the street, blocking their way, and he knew he wasn&#8217;t going to get any sleep in Connecticut.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Bridge&#8221; songs are populated with God, prayers, death, churches and even a hearse, but rather than gloom, &#8220;Bridge&#8221; invokes a kind of company for thought, a jumping off point for a pondering mood. More polished than &#8220;Starlite&#8221;, &#8220;Bridge&#8221; music points to the lyrics. &#8220;When I go downtown I always wear a corduroy suit / Cause it&#8217;s made of a hundred gutters that the rain can run right through. &#8221; - &#8220;Black and Brown Blues&#8221;&#8220;In the cold places where Spanish is spoken / Most wars end in the fall. &#8221; - &#8220;Pet Politics&#8221;The lyrics, Berman&#8217;s deep soothing voice, and the pretty melodies team up to make the record a beautiful listen. Famous for trumping up reasons why he won&#8217;t play live, Berman says he&#8217;ll break down and do it within the next year (you heard it here). In the meantime, he&#8217;s doing a spoken word tour in Europe, including a Peel Session. He sheepishly points to his own words in &#8220;The Frontier Index&#8221; to describe his situation: &#8220;When I was younger I was a cobra / In every case I wanted to be cool / Now that I&#8217;m older and sub-space is colder / I just want to say something true. &#8221;</p>
