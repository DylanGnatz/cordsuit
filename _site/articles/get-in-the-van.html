<p>There&#8217;s nothing like a good song to free your mind on the open road. Some of my earliest memories are the twin Willies, Boxcar and Nelson, singing of trains and a-travellin&#8217; on our family 8-track. Whether it be by plane, train or motorcycle - where there&#8217;s a wheel there&#8217;s a tune it seems. To celebrate the kick-off of the Silver Jews first ever tour, I present to you my favorite music to get a move on.</p>

<h2 id='1_free_born_man__jimmy_martin'>1. Free Born Man - Jimmy Martin</h2>

<p>This spirited anthem of a life-long drifter is delivered with such conviction you&#8217;d swear there was such a thing as bluegrass punk.</p>

<h2 id='2_rolling_o__king_kong'>2. Rolling O - King Kong</h2>

<p>A big ol&#8217; sugar rush of fun to help the kids in Louisville kick Slint. Great for bumpy roads.</p>

<h2 id='3_1952_vincent_black_lightning__richard_thompson'>3. 1952 Vincent Black Lightning - Richard Thompson</h2>

<p>Handing the motorcycle keys to a red-headed girl in black leather on your death bead. One sick ballad.</p>

<h2 id='4_racing_in_the_street__bruce_springsteen'>4. Racing in the Street - Bruce Springsteen</h2>

<p>I think the Boss holds the record on songs about cars. &#8220;Darkness on the Edge of Town&#8221; is one of my all-time knock me down favorite albums. The first time I heard this tune was sung by Guy Clark. I happened to be on his back porch with a bunch of old drunk friends during a late night thunderstorm and he happened to know the secret key to unlock the universe for us.</p>

<h2 id='5_stratfordonguy__liz_phair'>5. Stratford-On-Guy - Liz Phair</h2>

<p>A night flight to Chicago will be forever more sexy. Thanks, Liz.</p>

<h2 id='6_voodoo_cadillac__southern_culture_on_the_skids'>6. Voodoo Cadillac - Southern Culture on the Skids</h2>

<p>This baby&#8217;s got a hunk-a-hunk-a bass line. Cruising the streets listening to &#8220;Dirt Track Date&#8221; even makes my Volvo ride a little more funky.</p>

<h2 id='7_hard_road__lucinda_williams'>7. Hard Road - Lucinda Williams</h2>

<p>&#8220;With the spirit to guide you/And a friend beside you/You know you&#8217;ll win/If you&#8217;re only willin&#8221; - Play this song and you&#8217;ll never feel alone cross the miles.</p>

<h2 id='8_riding_with_mary__x'>8. Riding with Mary - X</h2>

<p>Oh Exene Cervenka, if only I could be you. A couple hours obsessing over X is a good way to pass the time on long drives.</p>

<h2 id='9_the_way__fastball'>9. The Way - Fastball</h2>

<p>This song was on the radio one summer when David and I lived in a mega-complex by the Mall called Mallard&#8217;s Crossings. I would listen to the song by the pool and dream away.</p>

<h2 id='10_the_letter__box_tops'>10. The Letter - Box Tops</h2>

<p>This song has an emotional pull so strong I feel like I&#8217;m the one that got the letter whenever I hear it. I took guitar lessons from Gary Tally, the guitar player in the Box Tops, when I first moved to Nashville. Lessons from legends for $25/hr can&#8217;t be beat. Although he totally lost me with the &#8220;color chords&#8221; schema.</p>

<h2 id='honorable_mention_elvis_theme_music__elvis_presley'>Honorable Mention: Elvis Theme Music - Elvis Presley</h2>

<p>Technically this is not a &#8220;song&#8221; but there is nothing like the Elvis theme music (da da da &#8211; da da da) to get me on my feet. A life long session player round here says they call this kind of thing &#8220;walk-in music. &#8221; I guess that&#8217;s cuz that&#8217;s what the band plays whenever a star takes the stage. Or &#8220;exits the building&#8221; in this case. I just think it&#8217;s so exciting sounding!</p>

<p>Take the Skinheads Bowling - Camper Van Beethoven. I&#8217;ve just always wanted to put this song on a top ten list. It really is not about traveling, unless you count the Ten Pin as a destination.</p>

<p>Okay, that is all.</p>
