<h2 id='jenny_mae_hey_baby_anyway'>Jenny Mae, &#8220;Hey Baby&#8221; (Anyway)</h2>

<p>Will Oldham (Palace): If I walked in and heard it, I&#8217;d turn around and walk back out.</p>

<p>Stephen Malkmus (Pavement, Silver Jews): It was just a pop song.</p>

<p>WO: It was no fun.</p>

<p>David Berman (Silver Jews): It was just a pop song, fine. Why aren&#8217;t you allowed to work in a pop paradigm now, when it&#8217;s fine for you turn on an AM radio and you have the 1910 Fruitgum Company.</p>

<p>WO: When there&#8217;s really quiet vocals and really loud guitars, it always seems annoying. It&#8217;s just no fun at all.</p>

<p>DB: I didn&#8217;t like it, but I&#8217;m curious what there motives were. If they&#8217;re into self glorification, then I have to castigate &#8216;em.</p>

<p>SM: They&#8217;re trying to sell, make a big hit.</p>

<p>WO: You can&#8217;t judge music by the intention of music.</p>

<p>DB: When you sing that way, you can&#8217;t hear the words.</p>

<p>WO: What&#8217;s the deal with vocals as instrument but still using language?</p>

<p>DB: There&#8217;s no point. They might as well moan and wheeze.</p>

<p>WO: Exactly. If they moaned and wheezed, it would be a lot better.</p>

<p>DB: But then it would just be (better) because it&#8217;s avant-garde.</p>

<h2 id='rocket_from_the_crypt_featuring_holly_golightly_eye_on_you_interscope'>Rocket from the Crypt featuring Holly Golightly, &#8220;Eye on You&#8221; (Interscope)</h2>

<p>DB: There was a male lead singer. I couldn&#8217;t tell if he had two backup singers.</p>

<p>WO: He had a guest vocalist.</p>

<p>DB: Right, but she was lower in the mix.</p>

<p>WO: She had a seperate part.</p>

<p>DB: But she was quieter than him. Emotionally, what she was putting forth was she was backing him up.</p>

<p>WO: I didn&#8217;t think so.</p>

<p>DB: He was being a revolutionary and he was out there preaching, and she was like Che Guevara&#8217;s lover. They had sex. Obviously the way he was singing and the way he was behind her - definitely they fucked each other. Either they&#8217;re sleeping together now, or when she got in the band they were sleeping together.</p>

<p>SM: She was like, &#8221;I&#8217;m just as bad as you.&#8221; but she got screwed in the mix.</p>

<p>WO: She was the highlight of the song.</p>

<h2 id='barry_adamson_come_hell_or_high_water_mute'>Barry Adamson, &#8220;Come Hell or High Water&#8221; (Mute)</h2>

<p>SM: Tortoisehead.</p>

<p>DB: The real question here: is he black? At first I thought he was white, like a Nick Cave guy, but he could be a black guy who is like Puffy.</p>

<p>Jennifer Herrema (Royal Trux): Nah, man. This is depressing but that&#8217;s about it.</p>

<p>DB: What does that mean if music is depressing? If the guy&#8217;s depressed, then it should make you feel better. How does it achieve that power over you? If it&#8217;s really bad music, it should not touch you at all.</p>

<p>WO: It&#8217;s potentially depressing. The fact that we can stop it makes it not depressing.</p>

<p>DB: From his voice do you think that he&#8217;s a depressed person?</p>

<p>JH: I wouldn&#8217;t even venture to say.</p>

<p>WO: He&#8217;s most depressed right after playback.</p>

<p>DB: It probably depends on how much sex he gets. If he has an active sex life, he&#8217;s probably not depressed. If he doesn&#8217;t have any sex life at all, he is.</p>

<p>JG: Why do you say that?</p>

<p>WO: He&#8217;s, like, 320 pounds.</p>

<p>DB: I bet that piano player has a good sex life. This is what Rollins should be doing - if Rollins went the Barry White route.</p>

<h2 id='page__plant_most_high_atlantic'>Page &amp; Plant &#8220;Most High&#8221; (Atlantic)</h2>

<p>SM: This could be a Soundgarden remix. Oh, this is the new Led Zeppelin album. I&#8217;ve heard this on the radio. It&#8217;s the single.</p>

<p>WO: It starts just like &#8220;Rid of Me.&#8221;</p>

<p>SM: He&#8217;s going for that religious, trancendental, Indian thing.</p>

<p>DB: It doesn&#8217;t seem like he&#8217;s saying to the women - like he used to with basically every syllable - &#8220;Fuck me. I&#8217;m going to fuck you.&#8221; He seems like he&#8217;s being just as passionate and soulful, but I&#8217;m picking up some Middle Eastern influences. A little Zen, possibly a little Tao.</p>

<p>SM: There&#8217;s going to be a world-music bit coming up now soon. It&#8217;s a weird pipe.</p>

<p>DB: Bagpipes, harmonium. I like that they&#8217;re making this weird instrument the lead, because normally you wouldn&#8217;t want it to play that long.</p>

<p>SM: Snakecharmer. They&#8217;re definately into referring to their old work. They sort of stopped at &#8220;In Through the Out Door&#8221; and didn&#8217;t try to make something different.</p>

<p>JH: It could be Jane&#8217;s Addiction.</p>

<p>DB: The production of that first Jane&#8217;s Addiction album reminds me of this.</p>

<p>WO: It&#8217;s Albini.</p>

<p>SM: I think it sounds good, though.</p>

<p>DB: It sounded a lot like &#8220;Kashmir.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id='the_scene_is_now_grenadine_from_object_lessons_songs_about_products_inconspicuous'>The Scene Is Now, &#8220;Grenadine&#8221; (from Object Lessons: Songs About Products) (Inconspicuous)</h2>

<p>JH: It&#8217;s making me happy.</p>

<p>DB: It&#8217;s like childrens&#8217; music but for adults, to make them feel young and childish.</p>

<p>SM: I thought that was Frank Black.</p>

<p>DB: He&#8217;s doing a better job now singing. I&#8217;ve got to give it a thumbs-up.</p>

<p>WO: Thumbs down here</p>

<p>SM: It gets points for weird time changes.</p>

<p>DB: I don&#8217;t know anything about that stuff.</p>

<p>SM: The vocals kind of bothered me.</p>

<h2 id='girls_against_boys_vogue_thing_dgc'>Girls Against Boys, &#8220;Vogue Thing&#8221; (DGC)</h2>

<p>SM: This is Girls Against Boys. I heard them on the radio too. It&#8217;s kind of like Cop Shoot Cop.</p>

<p>DB: That wasn&#8217;t going anywhere. That reminded me of artificial breast implants: They looked good but they felt really bad.</p>

<p>WO: As opposed to real breast implants?</p>

<h2 id='the_hangovers_i_hate_you_kill_rock_stars'>The Hangovers, &#8220;I Hate You&#8221; (Kill Rock Stars)</h2>

<p>DB: This reminds me of that comedian Judy Tenuta - a Lilith tour Judy Tenuta.</p>

<p>SM: I can&#8217;t deal with her voice.</p>

<p>WO: Is this Victoria Williams</p>

<p>Tony: It&#8217;s Gina Birch (from the Raincoats) and her new band.</p>

<p>DB: You know what offended me about that song? She doesn&#8217;t know what makes people feel good, and the worst part is she doesn&#8217;t give a damn about what makes people feel good. She was there to impress you with what she&#8217;s doing.</p>

<p>WO: Exactly. She grew up in a scene, and it&#8217;s like a job.</p>

<p>DB: I hate negative people - she was so negative. Ugh. The music was so gross and selfish and English.</p>

<p>SM: I don&#8217;t think she thought it was. I think she thought it was really happy. For where she came from, that was happy.</p>

<h2 id='bill_fox_song_for_a_drunken_nightingale_spinart'>Bill Fox, &#8220;Song for a Drunken Nightingale&#8221; (Spinart)</h2>

<p>DB: Is this a four-track in the 90&#8217;s in someone&#8217;s room or a studio in the 60&#8217;s?</p>

<p>SM: It&#8217;s probably Elliot Smith. It could be Dump. Is it Dump?</p>

<p>WO: Veto, veto, veto. We&#8217;re hearing song after song that&#8217;s no fun to listen to. Music is a time art, and as we&#8217;re progressing through time, we have to be achieving a climax, and we&#8217;re not.</p>

<p>SM: That&#8217;s fine. I like that. That was like Jim Croce. That sounded good.</p>

<h2 id='the_fleshtones_dont_be_a_dropout_from_james_bond_tribute_super_bad__65_zero_hour'>The Fleshtones, &#8220;Don&#8217;t Be a Dropout&#8221; (from James Bond tribute Super Bad @ 65) (Zero Hour)</h2>

<p>DB: Sounds like the Clash.</p>

<p>JH: Sounds like the Stones, man.</p>

<p>DB: The Clash sounded like the Stones.</p>

<p>SM: &#8220;Taking Care of Business.&#8221;</p>

<p>JH: Is it Graham Parker?</p>

<p>DB: Arto Lindsay?</p>

<h2 id='add_n_to_x_sound_of_accelerating_concrete_mute'>Add N to X, &#8220;Sound of Accelerating Concrete&#8221; (Mute)</h2>

<p>DB: Shit. I feel like i&#8217;m inside of Tron. Anyone feel like killing themselves?</p>

<p>SM: Another day at the Mercedes factory.</p>

<p>DB: This is the sound of them banging out tire wells. They know how to push all the wrong buttons.</p>
