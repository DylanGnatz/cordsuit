<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something special about recording at home,&#8221; muses Dave Berman of the Silver Jews, a loosely configured &#8220;band&#8221; best known for including two members of Pavement. &#8220;At home you get accidents. On our first 7-inch (Dime Map of the Reef), the second side has no drums for the first two minutes. But that&#8217;s only because Bob Nastanovich wasn&#8217;t home yet from his bus-driving job. So Steve Malkmus and I just started playing and then he came home, got a beer, popped it open, and then joined in. All of that is contained in the recording.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silver Jew Dave Berman feels observers miss the point when they peg lo-fi artists as lackadaisical and apathetic; their recording choice, he stresses, is a conscious reaction to the unwritten rules of the music biz. &#8220;Why is it,&#8221; Berman asks, &#8220;that musicians are the only artists who have to travel to a fortress of machines to do their work?&#8221; &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t like everything to have poor production,&#8221; says Dave Berman, &#8220;but there are very few studio albums that can capture loneliness. There&#8217;re exceptions, like Big Star&#8217;s 3rd, but it&#8217;s rare, because when everything&#8217;s in a studio, you know that it&#8217;s bankrolled by someone with business interests. When it&#8217;s music by someone at home, it&#8217;s an artifact from someone who, lacking money or connections or whatever, has no other outlet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berman is quick to point out, however, that there&#8217;s a &#8220;romance of distance&#8221; inherent in the pleasure of lo-fi recordings.</p>
