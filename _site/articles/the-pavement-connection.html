<p><em>The Pavement connection is really throwing the Silver Jews in the spotlight at the moment.</em></p>

<p>Yeah, when I was in England last week, I was sitting in a bar doing a Melody Maker interview when I thought &#8220;What the hell am I doing here? &#8221; This doesn&#8217;t make any sense as far as my life goes. So I said to the guy &#8220;Are you doing this because you like the record or because of the Pavement connection? &#8221; He said because of the Pavement connection.</p>

<p><em>Up until a few years ago only a handfull of people knew that the Silver Jews featured members of Pavement - what&#8217;s changed?</em></p>

<p>In the beginning I tried to hide the fact. I gave Steve a fake name and so forth but most people figured it out and it backfired. By keeping it a secret, people thought it was a bigger deal so we thought we&#8217;d stop telling secrets and tell the truth. If people then thought The Jew were a side project then fuck them. Bob and Steve treat it just as seriously as any other part of their lives. It&#8217;s certainly not a career for me, it&#8217;s like an extension of our friendship cos we&#8217;ve always played together. Technically, Pavement is a side project of the Silver Jews cos we were playing together well before Steve formed Pavement.</p>
