<p>On what do we base our categories? One man&#8217;s Deicide is another man&#8217;s Indigo Girls, I guess. Some recent discussion of the Silver Jews&#8217; The Arizona Record has made it painfully clear that there is some disagreement on what makes for good &#8220;pop-rock. &#8221; No surprise. The fact that Spin just called Drag City America&#8217;s best record label didn&#8217;t have much effect on how my friends regard this album &#8211; some didn&#8217;t believe I&#8217;d spent money on such crap, and some didn&#8217;t believe I&#8217;d scored such a find at Cutler&#8217;s.</p>

<p>So what do the Silver Jews sound like? An analogy: if Pavement spent the night sitting around drinking 40-ouncers and listening to VU albums, then decided to go jam and record it on a boom box with a normal-bias tape from Radio Shack that someone had lying around, hitting pause between songs, then took that tape to have it mastered for CD, it would probably sound a lot like The Arizona Record. If this sounds like a good thing to you, I guess it is. Truth be told, I like this a lot and think the songs are amazing. Truth be told, it is far and away the worst recording I have ever heard. Ever. And of course it&#8217;s on CD, winning the Biggest Waste of Digital Audio Technology award hands down.</p>

<p>For some strange reason, the last song on the Silver Jews album, &#8220;The Bar Scene from Star Wars,&#8221; sounds disturbingly Cocteau.</p>
