<p>Gather &#8216;round, Silver Jews fans and detractors, and hear the tale of David Berman&#8217;s past four years. After intentionally overdosing almost two years ago - despite the well-received 1999 poetry book &#8220;Actual Air&#8221; and 2001 album &#8220;Bright Flight&#8221; - Berman is back. On &#8220;Tanglewood Numbers&#8221;, he&#8217;s reunited with on-and-off again band members Stephen Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich (former Pavement drummer Steve West is also on this LP) and a host of others from his Nashville neighborhood and beyond. Berman&#8217;s descent into drugs and the requisite redemption hasn&#8217;t changed everything about the Silver Jews, but it&#8217;s changed a lot. The heartrending aspects (childlike wonder, grown-up wit) of Berman&#8217;s vocals and lyrics are intact. Malkmus&#8217; guitar still perforates the most pognant, aching moments and one-liners (&#8220;How can I love you if you won&#8217;t lie down? &#8220;) like a bayonet to the gut. Cassie Berman features prominently on vocals (a twangy, clear foil to her husband&#8217;s deep growls), and the production is built to withstand the layers created by the 15 or so players. What&#8217;s missing most will probably not be missed at all: Berman&#8217;s tendency to sound slack, sluggish and a bit lackluster. He cares more now, and caring always hurts more but yields better results.</p>

<p>MAGNET contacted Berman in his Tanglewood Street home. &#8220;It&#8217;s been four years since &#8220;Bright Flight&#8221;. &#8220;For a lot of reasons, I just sunk deeper into drugs and just waited around to die. Eventually, I decided to finish the whole thing off. The rest is somewhat predictable: detox, rehab, God, comeback, confetti, hush money, sexpos√©, prosecution, bartending school. &#8220;Were you working on &#8220;Tanglewood Numbers&#8221; before you overdosed? &#8220;No. I lost about three years of work, in the sense that I didn&#8217;t do any. I started writing these songs last July, after I&#8217;d been home about six months. &#8220;Your wife&#8217;s singing plays a larger role than ever. Does that reflect a permanent change in the Silver Jews&#8217; lineup? &#8220;Things change and change back. I never like when bands changed for good, letting you know they&#8217;d never be the same again. I want the band to be the same again when that&#8217;s what the song needs. For the people who love the Silver Jews, we will be their rock. That&#8217;s a new guarantee. &#8220;Your albums tend to inspire love/hate reactions. Do you hope &#8220;Tanglewood Numbers&#8221; will change that? &#8220;I hope it gets to those who have ignore the band or have been discouraged from listening to the albums. As for the haters, let them picket the awards dinner when I&#8217;m inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. I can just see it now. It&#8217;s January, in the future, and old (rock critic) Jim !DeRogatis is all bundled up against a bitter wind coming off Lake Erie, steam coming out of his maw. He&#8217;s breathing hard, leaning against a frosted flagpole, with a rough-hewn picket sign fallen at his feet. It is only then that you notice he&#8217;s bleeding. &#8220;Is it true you&#8217;re about to begin writing your first novel? &#8220;No. I could never write a novel. I feel a moral responsibility to do the work I&#8217;m best at.</p>
