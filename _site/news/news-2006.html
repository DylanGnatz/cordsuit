<h2 id='silver_jews_new_years_east_coast'>Silver Jews New Years East Coast</h2>

<p>In an article on Pitchfork, (http://pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/38398/Silver_Jews_Kick_Off_Tour Silver Jews Kick Off Tour), after wrapping up the westcoast leg of their current tour, the Joos are coming back east for some dates around New Years in NYC and Northampton, MA. These shows are currently unlisted on the bands webpage. However, be assured at least one ticket has been purchased through Ticketweb for New Years Eve.UPDATE: Tour cancelled, due to band &#8220;winterization. &#8221; Refunds from Ticketweb apparently will be processed automatically. Here&#8217;s the band&#8217;s official announcement:(http://www.silverjews.net Notice: Snowshow). Any grievances may be sent to: P.O. Box 160009, Nashville, TN 37216</p>

<h2 id='silver_jews_in_plan_b'>Silver Jews in Plan B</h2>

<h2 id='o_captain_my_captain'>O Captain! My Captain!</h2>

<p>Nextbook.org&#8217;s latest podcast is a rare audio interview with David Berman in which he talks about the benefits of home ownership, religious and musical convergence in Nashville, and his growing interest in the Book. Berman also plays a new song he wrote to the lyrics of Walt Whitman&#8217;s (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Captain%21_My_Captain%21 &#8220;O Captain! My Captain! &#8220;) Berman spoke with Nextbook&#8217;s Sara Ivry just before heading to New York&#8217;s Webster Hall where the Silver Jews were playing another sold-out show. Here&#8217;s a link to the interview: (http://www.nextbook.org/cultural/feature.html?id=309 Silver Lining)</p>

<h2 id='notice_of_collusion'>Notice of Collusion</h2>

<p>We suspect there has been a clerical error at MTV2, which, if it remains uncorrected, will have the Silver Jews (Cassie and David in this case) co-hosting a video show they have called &#8220;subterranean&#8221; next week in person. It will be shown on March 12 at midnight.</p>

<p>They are hopefully going to play a &#8220;Sleeping is the Only Love&#8221; video that Brent Stewart (the fellow who made the &#8220;How Can I Love You&#8221; video) shot yesterday and edited last night, continuing to make a big name for himself in the under 100 dollar MTV-worthy video world.</p>

<h2 id='time_out_tel_aviv'>Time Out Tel Aviv</h2>

<p>There&#8217;s an article and video clip in the digital format of Time Out Tel Aviv. Check it out at:(http://digital.timeout.co.il/activemagazine/welcome/timeout_171.asp Time Out)</p>

<h2 id='silver_jews_in_scotland'>Silver Jews in Scotland</h2>

<p>Following much speculation, we&#8217;re delighted to confirm that skewed rock idols The Silver Jews will play their first-everScottish dates at this year&#8217;s Triptych festival. They play Edinburgh&#8217;s Bongo Club on Thursday April 27 and Glasgow&#8217;s Tramwayon Friday April 28. A London gig also takes place on Tuesday April 25.</p>

<p>Performing live for the very first time in a celebratedfifteen-year career, enigmatic versifier David Berman and his endlessly erudite Silver Jews are finally set to gratify ears andenliven hearts with a clutch of inaugural Stateside shows in March; before crossing the water to woo Triptych aficionados andmusic lovers with their heady, hazy, hairy, grace.
