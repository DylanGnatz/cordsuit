<h2 id='silver_jews_end__lead_singer_bids_his_wellwishers_adieu'>Silver Jews End - Lead Singer Bids his Well-Wishers Adieu</h2>

<p>Hello, my friend.</p>

<p>Cassie and I went to the cave and it looks great. 58 degrees but the humidity makes it feel like 72.I&#8217;m just going to play fifteen songs. My fifteen favorite ones.</p>

<p>A dollar per song. Plus Arnett Hollow. I don&#8217;twant to keep you underground for too long. Fall Creek Falls State Park State Lodge is great by the way its like the one from a place wherein they called Falls - Yes I cancelled the South American shows. I&#8217;ll have to see the ABC Countries another way.</p>

<p>I guess I am moving over to another category. Screenwriting or Muckraking.I&#8217;ve got to move on. Can&#8217;t be like all the careerists doncha know.I&#8217;m forty two and I know what to do.I&#8217;m a writer, see?Cassie is taking it the hardest. She&#8217;s a fan and a player but she sees how happy i am with the decision.</p>

<p>I always said we would stop before we got bad. If I continue to record I might accidentally write the song answer to Shiny Happy People.</p>

<p>What, you thought I was going to hang on to the bitter end like Marybeth Hamilton?love david</p>

<h2 id='my_father_my_attack_dog'>My Father, My Attack Dog</h2>

<p>Now that the Joos are over I can tell you my gravest secret. Worse than suicide, worse than crack addiction:My father.</p>

<p>You might be surprised to know he is famous, for terrible reasons.</p>

<p>My father is a despicable man. My father is a sort of human molestor.</p>

<p>An exploiter. A scoundrel. A world historical motherfucking son of a bitch. (sorry grandma)You can read about him here.http://www.bermanexposed.orgMy life is so wierd. It&#8217;s allegorical to the nth. My father went to college at Transylvania University.</p>

<p>You see what I&#8217;m saying.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago I demanded he stop his work. Close down his company or I would sever our relationship.</p>

<p>He refused. He has just gotten worse. More evil. More powerful. We&#8217;ve been &#8220;estranged&#8221; for over three years.</p>

<p>Even as a child I disliked him. We were opposites. I wanted to read. He wanted to play games.</p>

<p>He is a union buster.</p>

<p>When I got out of college I joined the Teamsters (the guards were union organized at the Whitney).</p>

<p>I went off to hide in art and academia.</p>

<p>I fled through this art portal for twenty years. In the mean time my Dad started a very very badcompany called Berman and Company.</p>

<p>He props up fast food/soda/factory farming/childhood obesity and diabetes/drunk driving/secondhand smoke.</p>

<p>He attacks animal lovers, ecologists, civil action attorneys, scientists, dieticians, doctors, teachers.</p>

<p>His clients include everyone from the makers of Agent Orange to the Tanning Salon Owners of America.</p>

<p>He helped ensure the minimum wage did not move a penny from 1997-2007!The worst part for me as a writer is what he does with the english language.</p>

<p>Though vicious he is a doltish thinkerand his spurious editorials rely on doublethink and always with the Lashon Hara.</p>

<p>As I studied Judaism over the years, the shame and the shanda,grew almost too much. my heart was constantly on fire for justice. I could find no relief.</p>

<p>This winter I decided that the SJs were too small of a force to ever come close toundoing a millionth of all the harm he has caused. To you and everyone you know.</p>

<p>Literally, if you eat food or have a job, he is reaching you.I&#8217;ve always hid this terrible shame from you, the fan. The SJs have always stood autonomous and clear.</p>

<p>Hopefully it won&#8217;t contaminate your feelings about the work.</p>

<p>My life has been riddled with Ibsenism. In a way I am the son of a demon come to make good the damage.</p>

<p>Previously I thought, through songs and poems and drawings I could find and build a refuge away from his world.</p>

<p>But there is the matter of Justice.</p>

<p>And i&#8217;ll tell you it&#8217;s not just a metaphor. The desire for it actually burns.</p>

<p>It hurts.</p>

<p>There needs to be something more. I&#8217;ll see what that might be.DCBif you want to know what evil Herr Attackdog is currently up to look here:http://www.alternet.org/workplace/120426/ad_wars%3A_%27dr._evil%27_vs._unions_over_employee_free_choice_act/</p>
