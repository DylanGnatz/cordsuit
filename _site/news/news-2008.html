<p>Silver Jews are due to appear at the All Tomorrow&#8217;s Parties Festival in May of next year.</p>

<p>A recent post on the All Tomorrow&#8217;s Parties website contained the following announcement:&#8221;SILVER JEWS + JENS LEKMAN SIGN UP<br />Do you like the Silver Jews? If so you are in luck because they have just confirmed they will play ATP in May alongside new confirmations Jens Lekman, Mono, Tony Teardrop and The Drift. &#8220;The festival, which is curated by Explosions in the Sky, is held at Butlin&#8217;s Holiday Centre in Minehead, Somerset UK.</p>

<h2 id='the_holy_modal_rounders_bound_to_lose_and_silver_jew'>THE HOLY MODAL ROUNDERS: BOUND TO LOSE and SILVER JEW</h2>

<p>This month Monorail Film Club turns it&#8217;s attention to two generations of American underground music.</p>

<p>The Holy Modal Rounders: Bound To Lose chronicles the wild forty-year history of &#8216;The Rounders&#8217;, who originated as a 1960&#8217;s Greenwich Village psychedelic folk duo of Peter Stampfel and Steve Weber. Featured in the film are Dennis Hopper, former band member Sam Shepard, Peter Tork of The Monkees, Ira Kaplan of Yo La Tengo, The Fugs, Loudon Wainwright III, among many others.</p>

<p>Silver Jew is an intimate portrait of sometimes reclusive poet/musician David Berman and his band the Silver Jews on their historic first visit to Israel in 2006. For Berman this trip was always going to be significant and emotional and the film offers a unique insight into the charismatic word-genius as he performs his music in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem with a country-tinged incarnation of his group which includes his wife Cassie.</p>
