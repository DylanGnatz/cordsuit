_Hi there, introduce yourself and your band please?_

Hello, I'm David, and this is the band: Peyton Pinkerton and William Tyler on guitar. Tony Crow, keyboards. Brian Kotzur: drums and my bass Cassie who plays wife. 

_Are the band you tour with the band you are now recording with?_

Yes. I warmed them up for six months and then I let them rest a year. Next, I throw them in the studio with no time to prepare, then I disappear with the tapes and screen all their calls for 2-3 months. 

_The earlier Silver Jews songs sounded like rough ideas which were quickly recorded, was that the case?_ 

That's it. 'Rough ideas. Quickly Recorded.' 

_By the time of the Natural Bridge all the songs were much more coherent and more 'perfectly formed', was there a turning point for you in terms of your song writing?_

The turning point was likely the city of Hartford, CT where the album was recorded. I don't want to tear down their city, but I think I was compelled to create these adjunct worlds to which I could flee to under stress. 

_When did you move to Nashville and do you think moving there changed your music at all?_ 

1998. I think it helped me to decide that music could be a lifelong art. The rock precedence is not promising in that regard. 

_When recording the songs for the Arizona record, what were your influences? I only ask this because the first time I heard Jackson Nightz I was listening to music on shuffle and I thought I was listening to some early Sebadoh record._ 

Well, definitely not Sebadoh! I'm sure both songs were influenced by the Daniel Johnston cassettes.

_Have you ever considered re-recording any of the songs off the Arizona record? Secret Knowledge of Backroads and Jackson Nightz in particular stand out to me on this record._

I guess if I'm ever struggling for reasons to be relevant, you know touring 'American Water', etc. I might go lower. 

_What was the inspiration behind 'I remember me'? Was it based on anything?_ 

It was based on a fear I had about losing my bass player. Purposely a little purple, the song was supposed to scare me in to getting married by painting an awful loneliness. 

_When you felt low in what way did it affect your lyrics? Did you feel you became more reserved in what you wrote or did you find writing a way of expressing how you felt?_ 

Any depressing writing I've done, was mostly done in 'good times' looking back, mapping the contours of the bad times, delineating them, or extracting them via psychic surgery. 

_Prior to touring I understand the only kind of gigs you played would be a few songs at parties. Was this true and if so can you give an account of what these performances were like?_

I got trapped into playing in a bar in Houston after it was closed. The owner had a guitar and when I said I didn't remember the chords or the words to any of my songs, he ran upstairs to his apartment and brought down a three ring binder with guitar tabs for all four albums.

_It has been 8 years since the publication of Actual Air, can we expect any more of your poetry to be published?_

That is something I need to think about more. 

_With your writing, when you put pen to paper do you know what you're going to write? Or can a lyric turn into a poem into a story?_

If I make the decision to write something, it is to fulfil a need I have for a song or a poem. Someone needs a poem from me and I can't politely put it off anymore. I need two more songs to make an album. Dreaming up the content is the second step.

_I wouldn't be surprised if I learnt that you had written a novel, is this something you'd be interested in doing?_

No, I think I prefer short forms. I don't consider prose fiction to be relevant anymore, anyway.
