"Were you happy with American Water?"

Yes. It lacked the tentativeness of so much music. I thought it was a man's record. That the other two were written by a manchild. 

"At any point did you feel it was the last Silver Jews album?"

Yes. I had lost interest in working in music. Partly, feeling sorry for myself that we didn't get the respect we deserved.

"Does being a poet help with songwriting or get in the way?"

It's pretty much my only clear advantage point so i'll say it helps. 

"Are any of your poems companions to songs?"

No, not that I'm aware of. 

"Is there still an 'Actual Air' hardcover in the works?"

Supposedly. 

"After a 3-year absence what brought you back to the Silver Jews?"

On Feb. 1st I decided I needed some income so i very methodically sat down in the dining room and five days a week for three hours a day I wrote the record. 

'Bright Flight', "What is the story behind the title?"

No story. Just when a plane breaks the clouds after takeoff and the sun is searing thru the cabin. 

"How big an influence did living in Nashville have in the feel of this album?"

Some. A lot. I don't know. I do know I love living here and would like to stay here. 

"Will there be any touring to support this album?"

Are fucking kidding me? 

"How does the prospect of another Silver Jews album sound?"

Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. 

"I noticed you did some artwork for a national magazine recently, how did you land that job? And will we see more art from you?"

Drag City wants to put out a book of drawings but fuck if I'm going to have everything written about me from now on use the term "renaissance man" I just wont have it!!

"What was the last good book you read?"

Richard Yates Collected short fiction. 

"Do you follow contemporary music closely? What are your top 5 albums of this year?"

'I hope you dance' Lee Ann Womack single  
parts of U2 album  
les savy fav  
US Maple 'acre thrills'  
Jimmy Martin's greatest hits
