_The Pavement connection is really throwing the Silver Jews in the spotlight at the moment._

Yeah, when I was in England last week, I was sitting in a bar doing a Melody Maker interview when I thought "What the hell am I doing here? " This doesn't make any sense as far as my life goes. So I said to the guy "Are you doing this because you like the record or because of the Pavement connection? " He said because of the Pavement connection. 

_Up until a few years ago only a handfull of people knew that the Silver Jews featured members of Pavement - what's changed?_

In the beginning I tried to hide the fact. I gave Steve a fake name and so forth but most people figured it out and it backfired. By keeping it a secret, people thought it was a bigger deal so we thought we'd stop telling secrets and tell the truth. If people then thought The Jew were a side project then fuck them. Bob and Steve treat it just as seriously as any other part of their lives. It's certainly not a career for me, it's like an extension of our friendship cos we've always played together. Technically, Pavement is a side project of the Silver Jews cos we were playing together well before Steve formed Pavement.
