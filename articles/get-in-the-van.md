There's nothing like a good song to free your mind on the open road. Some of my earliest memories are the twin Willies, Boxcar and Nelson, singing of trains and a-travellin' on our family 8-track. Whether it be by plane, train or motorcycle - where there's a wheel there's a tune it seems. To celebrate the kick-off of the Silver Jews first ever tour, I present to you my favorite music to get a move on.

## 1. Free Born Man - Jimmy Martin

This spirited anthem of a life-long drifter is delivered with such conviction you'd swear there was such a thing as bluegrass punk.

## 2. Rolling O - King Kong

A big ol' sugar rush of fun to help the kids in Louisville kick Slint. Great for bumpy roads.

## 3. 1952 Vincent Black Lightning - Richard Thompson

Handing the motorcycle keys to a red-headed girl in black leather on your death bead. One sick ballad.

## 4. Racing in the Street - Bruce Springsteen

I think the Boss holds the record on songs about cars. "Darkness on the Edge of Town" is one of my all-time knock me down favorite albums. The first time I heard this tune was sung by Guy Clark. I happened to be on his back porch with a bunch of old drunk friends during a late night thunderstorm and he happened to know the secret key to unlock the universe for us.

## 5. Stratford-On-Guy - Liz Phair

A night flight to Chicago will be forever more sexy. Thanks, Liz.

## 6. Voodoo Cadillac - Southern Culture on the Skids

This baby's got a hunk-a-hunk-a bass line. Cruising the streets listening to "Dirt Track Date" even makes my Volvo ride a little more funky.

## 7. Hard Road - Lucinda Williams 

"With the spirit to guide you/And a friend beside you/You know you'll win/If you're only willin" - Play this song and you'll never feel alone cross the miles.

## 8. Riding with Mary - X 

Oh Exene Cervenka, if only I could be you. A couple hours obsessing over X is a good way to pass the time on long drives.

## 9. The Way - Fastball 

This song was on the radio one summer when David and I lived in a mega-complex by the Mall called Mallard's Crossings. I would listen to the song by the pool and dream away.

## 10. The Letter - Box Tops

This song has an emotional pull so strong I feel like I'm the one that got the letter whenever I hear it. I took guitar lessons from Gary Tally, the guitar player in the Box Tops, when I first moved to Nashville. Lessons from legends for $25/hr can't be beat. Although he totally lost me with the "color chords" schema. 

## Honorable Mention: Elvis Theme Music - Elvis Presley

Technically this is not a "song" but there is nothing like the Elvis theme music (da da da -- da da da) to get me on my feet. A life long session player round here says they call this kind of thing "walk-in music. " I guess that's cuz that's what the band plays whenever a star takes the stage. Or "exits the building" in this case. I just think it's so exciting sounding!

Take the Skinheads Bowling - Camper Van Beethoven. I've just always wanted to put this song on a top ten list. It really is not about traveling, unless you count the Ten Pin as a destination.

Okay, that is all.
