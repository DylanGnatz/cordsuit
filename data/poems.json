  "title": "Self Portrait at 28",
  "body": "By David BermanI know it's a bad title\\but I'm giving it to myself as a gift\\on a day nearly canceled by sunlight\\when the entire hill is approaching\\the ideal of Virginia\\brochured with goldenrod and loblolly\\and I think \"at least I have not woken up\\with a bloody knife in my hand\"\\by then having absently wandered\\one hundred yards from the house\\while still seated in this chair\\with my eyes closed.It is a certain hill\\the one I imagine when I hear the word \"hill\"\\and if the apocalypse turns out\\to be a world-wide nervous breakdown\\if our five billion minds collapse at once\\well I'd call that a surprise ending\\and this hill would still be beautiful\\a place I wouldn't mind dying\\alone or with you.I am trying to get at something\\and I want to talk very plainly to you\\so that we are both comforted by the honesty.\\You see there is a window by my desk\\I stare out when I am stuck\\though the outdoors has rarely inspired me to write\\and I don't know why I keep staring at it.My childhood hasn't made good material either\\mostly being a mulch of white minutes\\with a few stand out moments,\\popping tar bubbles on the driveway in the summer\\a certain amount of pride at school\\everytime they called it \"our sun\"\\and playing football when the only play\\was \"go out long\" are what stand out now.If squeezed for more information\\I can remember old clock radios\\with flipping metal numbers\\and an entree called Surf and Turf.As a way of getting in touch with my origins\\every night I set the alarm clock\\for the time I was born so that waking up\\becomes a historical reenactment\\and the first thing I do\\is take a reading of the day\\and try to flow with it\\like when you're riding a mechanical bull\\and you strain to learn the pattern quickly\\so you don't inadvertently resist it. II two I can't remember being born\\and no one else can remember it either\\even the doctor who I met years later\\at a cocktail party.\\It's one of the little disappointments\\that makes you think about getting away\\going to Holly Springs or Coral Gables\\and taking a room on the square\\with a landlady whose hands are scored\\by disinfectant, telling the people you meet\\that you are from Alaska, and listen\\to what they have to say about Alaska\\until you have learned much more about Alaska\\than you ever will about Holly Springs or Coral Gables. Sometimes I am buying a newspaper\\in a strange city and think\\\"I am about to learn what it's like to live here.\"\\Oftentimes there is a news item\\about the complaints of homeowners\\who live beside the airport\\and I realize that I read an article\\on this subject nearly once a year\\and always receive the same image.I am in bed late at night\\in my house near the airport\\listening to the jets fly overhead\\a strange wife sleeping beside me.\\In my mind, the bedroom is an amalgamation\\of various cold medicine commercial sets\\(there is always a box of tissue on the nightstand). I know these recurring news articles are clues,\\flaws in the design though I haven't figured out\\how to string them together yet,\\but I've begun to notice that the same people\\are dying over and over again,\\for instance Minnie Pearl\\who died this year\\for the fourth time in four years. III three Today is the first day of Lent\\and once again I'm not really sure what it is.\\How many more years will I let pass\\before I take the trouble to ask someone?It reminds of this morning\\when you were getting ready for work.\\I was sitting by the space heater\\numbly watching you dress\\and when you asked why I never wear a robe\\I had so many good reasons\\I didn't know where to begin.If you were cool in high school\\you didn't ask too many questions.\\You could tell who'd been to last night's\\big metal concert by the new t-shirts in the hallway.\\You didn't have to ask\\and that's what cool was:\\the ability to deduct\\to know without asking.\\And the pressure to simulate coolness\\means not asking when you don't know,\\which is why kids grow ever more stupid.A yearbook's endpages, filled with promises\\to stay in touch, stand as proof of the uselessness\\of a teenager's promise. Not like I'm dying\\for a letter from the class stoner\\ten years on but... Do you remember the way the girls\\would call out \"love you!\"\\conveniently leaving out the \"I\"\\as if they didn't want to commit\\to their own declarations. I agree that the \"I\" is a pretty heavy concept\\and hope you won't get uncomfortable\\if I should go into some deeper stuff here. IV four There are things I've given up on\\like recording funny answering machine messages.\\It's part of growing older\\and the human race as a group\\has matured along the same lines.\\It seems our comedy dates the quickest.\\If you laugh out loud at Shakespeare's jokes\\I hope you won't be insulted \\if I say you're trying too hard.\\Even sketches from the original Saturday Night Live\\seem slow-witted and obvious now. It's just that our advances are irrepressible.\\Nowadays little kids can't even set up lemonade stands.\\It makes people too self-conscious about the past,\\though try explaining that to a kid. I'm not saying it should be this way. All this new technology\\will eventually give us new feelings\\that will never completely displace the old ones\\leaving everyone feeling quite nervous\\and split in two. We will travel to Mars\\even as folks on Earth\\are still ripping open potato chip\\bags with their teeth. Why? I don't have the time or intelligence\\to make all the connections\\like my friend Gordon\\(this is a true story\\who grew up in Braintree Massachusetts\\and had never pictured a brain snagged in a tree\\until I brought it up.\\He'd never broken the name down to its parts.\\By then it was too late.\\He had moved to Coral Gables. V five The hill out my window is still looking beautiful\\suffused in a kind of gold national park light\\and it seems to say,\\I'm sorry the world could not possibly\\use another poem about Orpheus\\but I'm available if you're not working\\on a self-portrait or anything. I'm watching my dog have nightmares,\\twitching and whining on the office floor\\and I try to imagine what beast\\has cornered him in the meadow\\where his dreams are set. I'm just letting the day be what it is:\\a place for a large number of things\\to gather and interact --\\not even a place but an occasion\\a reality for real things. Friends warned me not to get too psychedelic\\or religious with this piece:\\\"They won't accept it if it's too psychedelic\\or religious,\" but these are valid topics\\and I'm the one with the dog twitching on the floor\\possibly dreaming of me\\that part of me that would beat a dog\\for no good reason\\no reason that a dog could see.I am trying to get at something so simple\\that I have to talk plainly\\so the words don't disfigure it\\and if it turns out that what I say is untrue\\then at least let it be harmless\\like a leaky boat in the reeds\\that is bothering no one. VI six I can't trust the accuracy of my own memories,\\many of them having blended with sentimental\\telephone and margarine commercials\\plainly ruined by Madison Avenue\\though no one seems to call the advertising world\\\"Madison Avenue\" anymore. Have they moved?\\Let's get an update on this. But first I have some business to take care of. I walked out to the hill behind our house\\which looks positively Alaskan today\\and it would be easier to explain thisif I had a picture to show you\\but I was with our young dog\\and he was running through the tall grass\\like running through the tall grass\\is all of life together\\until a bird calls or he finds a beer can\\and that thing fills all the space in his head. You see,\\his mind can only hold one thought at a time\\and when he finally hears me call his name\\he looks up and cocks his head\\and for a single moment\\my voice is everything: Self-portrait at 28."

  "title": "Clip-On Tie: The Diary of a New York Art Museum Security Guard",
  "body": "by David Berman, published in Baffler #6:\"If there's ever a problem, I film it and it's no longer a problem. It's a film\":- Andy Warhol It would be a tragedy to spend your whole life desperately wanting to be something that you already were, all along. On Fridays the guards are given ten minutes to take their paychecks to the bank. The beautiful tellers have become arrogant from handling money all day. If they have time, they flirt with the big accounts. European tourists move about the museum half-interested, exactly fifty percent interested. Do they ever spill a drink or piss on their shoes? Sometimes, when a beautiful Italian girl wanders into an empty gallery I fantasize about walking over and kissing her on the neck. When she turned around and saw that I was a guard, I would straighten up and whisper \"no kissing allowed.\" The classicist's theme is the recovery of the subjective mind, the healing of the subjective mind. Well, our courts are clogged with these minds. The nineteen year old Cusies are the only twins on the guard force. The girls insist that their spooked grandmother tried to murder them twice during their infancy. First, she gave them diet gum in an attempt to dehydrate them. Second, she sent them new blankets in the mail-the blankets had been soaked in insecticide. Christ's message twisted: Only love your enemies. If the fable of \"The grasshopper and the ants\" was amended so that the world ended before the turn of winter, then the grasshopper would have been wiser and the moral would have vindicated him. In a story, the location of the ending is very deliberate. I've been photographing the imprints that deck chairs leave on the back of people's legs. A lady comes into the museum: \"I am a woman on TV. You have never had a TV. . . now get off my show!\" It only took a few minutes of this kind of talk to make me feel like the intruder. \"He\" was a sensitive reader, almost too delicate to withstand the commands and admonitions of punctuation. Two drunks outside the Greenpoint subway: \"You better leave an hour early to get there on time.\" They are lying, they never go anywhere, I thought to myself. For whose benefit would they be acting? Why am I so suspicious? John Baldessari burned all his pre-1967 paintings. \"I think that's odd behaviour but I would like to get in touch with him anyway, to see about using the ashes as makeup for this play I'm writing about British coal miners.\" After guarding masterpieces for weeks, it feels good to stand in my dentist's office before this cheap painting of a ship. If the world was a bit smaller, just three neighborhoods smaller, maybe things would work out. I've heard that there's a scarcity of luxury. In the movie theatres each person has to share an armrest with a stranger. What Duchamp did with the urinal no longer surprises me, what surprises me is the idea that they had urinals back then. I am waiting for the bus when I smell something burning. I turn to the man standing next to me and ask if he smells it too. In preparing to speak he lets a cloud of condensed breath out into the freezing air. For a half second my mind plays a trick on me. \"Oh no, he's burning,\" I think. No one gets hungry at the sight of a lush cornfield or a herd of cattle. It's enough to tell you that we're full of education, not awareness. The painter eyes his subject. It's a single piece of fruit, yellow and shaped like a lightbulb, split open to show the cavity where the pit would normally be, if the pit were not swirling around inside the painter's mouth."

  "title": "The Summer Before The Night Ecstasy Became Illegal In The State Of Texas",
  "body": "by David Berman, taken from a feature in Feed Mag.MY FRIEND KYLE always had a lot of money and could get me into the expensive kind of trouble without the trouble sticking. He didn't mind paying for me if it meant raising hell with loyal company. We were seventeen. You only needed one reason to be friends at that age. I figured we had at least three. So we broke the law every day in every way and laughed our asses off at the fucking stupid world. In late April we began to hear rumors about a new drug in the Metroplex. It was in the gay bars. Kids at the Arts Magnet were getting it. Certain people at certain parties had it and it was magical. They called it X. It was supposed to make you unaccountably happy and tolerant of everyone from headbangers to rich fucks. Even \"douchebags.\" Psychiatrists had been using it in therapy for years, we were told. It was legal and local product (it was still special to Texas at that time). It would make you love and accept anyone. Even yourself. This was a complicated promise for the teenager roiling with hate and confusion. I hardly believed it. But one night Kyle pulled out some foil holding four tablets, we each swallowed two, and went to a party where a lot of people were going to be doing it. Coming around the corner of that house, I'll never forget the scene. Every high-school rule was being broken before me. The lions were chatting up the lambs. I saw sworn enemies talking like longtime companions; a prickly society bitch on her knees sifting white garden pebbles through her hands with happy eyes; a brutal wrestler from my school with his arms wrapped around the trunk of a pecan tree, saying his first words to me ever, \"Hi David,\" sweetly, as I walked by. I rolled my jeans up to my knees and sat at the edge of the pool. Maybe for the first time I felt like no one was going to try to push me in. The stereo was playing \"Blues for Allah\" instead of the customary \"Eliminator.\" Nearby, two linebackers were confessing how much they depended on each other \"on and off the field.\" I felt myself giving in to all the kindness, not caring if it was a lie or not. By the time a hot Fort Worth Jewess sprang into in my lap and began running her fingers through my hair, I was sold. At sunrise, I came in through the sliding glass. I woke my father and his new bride, apologized for staying out all night, and pulled a chair up beside the bed. I continued to sit there and smile down on them. I said, \"I just want you to know how much I love you, Dad.\" Incredibly, he did not kick my ass. That morning was never mentioned again. AS I SAID BEFORE, ecstasy was still legal and as such carried virtually no stigma. Kyle's uncle kept a jar of tablets on his desk at his car dealership. Law-abiding adults were taking them at North Dallas cocktail parties. They were even sold behind the bars like cigarettes and openly hawked on street corners downtown. That summer, I crushed two sports cars with my homely Buick, received six speeding tickets (three in one day), two tickets for public urination, impregnated a Collin County judge's daughter, and had a bottle of MD 20/20 broken over my head. Approximately none of it registered with me. A very real fault of the drug. I'm going to skip the scenes of me chasing daisies and singing to stray dogs from still bulldozer cabs. I was exercising horses that summer for cash, and X hangovers were A-OK for barreling over the dull scrubland. Sometime in August, the lawmakers in Austin finally got around to outlawing ecstasy. What a gift for the dealers! The price of ecstasy immediately quadrupled and the production costs plummeted as the manufacturers began cutting the pills with all manner of horrible stuff. The night the law went through, I went to a concert at the Bronco Bowl and snagged two of the newly illegal pills for a dear price. I had never seen them in capsules and had no idea it was a sign they were crushing the old \"legal\" pills and mixing them with laxative, mannitol, low-grade speed, whatever. Once inside, I spent a half hour wiggling my way to the front of the floor. Unfortunately, when I got there I had a big problem. Not only were the drugs not kicking in, they were causing me to have to shit real bad. Michael Stipe was singing \"Moon River\" (hey!) a cappella and I knew I was going to blow if I didn't part this shoulder-to-shoulder crowd and make it to the restroom. The audience was frozen in place and dead silent as I plowed through, \"Excuse me, excuse me, emergency here, please, please\" ( I think I even yelled \"gangway,\" such was my ambition to get through), completely stepping on the vocalist's Ethel Merman star turn and nearly getting shhhhhed to death. I passed the rest of the concert in a nasty stall gritting my teeth, sweating and coming to terms with what was clearly the symbolic end of a spaced-out summer. Fifteen years on, I can honestly say I'm glad it was outlawed. After three months of its use I had lost all discretion and was prepared to trust just about anyone. Worse yet, it was turning me into a joiner. That's not who I am. Anyway, ecstasy was not to find its true customer base until years later, when the strangely passive kids who grew up in the child protectorate of the U.S. eighties and nineties came of age, craving depersonalization. Apparently it helps them dance. They're a very attractive lot. Have you seen them dance? David Berman lives in Nashville. His first book, Actual Air, came out last year via Open City Press."

  "title": "Nervous Ashers: The Legend of the Silver Jews",
  "body": "by David BermanThere were mountain huts full of smallpox strung out along the hillsides between Escatawpa and Morgan City, birds boiling up and out of freestanding chimneys under the routine advent of rainbows and chainsaws, the old sound of cheap labour rising and falling in the weather that was like frosted bank glass and advancing. There were heaps of tangled sawhorses and tripwire, vacant jasper and wolframite mines, mounds of dead Ataris and scarred desk drawer Bibles scattered across the abandoned counties that lay inert as rope.Hazel and Bobby lived together in an old slave shack I used to rent out in the upper fields. They cut Canadian thistle and picked sloe berries off the blackhorn for a living, slashing their hands and bickering all day in the frayed heat, visiting me in the cool mainhouse most evenings. We'd sit in the rooms without ceilings, drinking whitehill whiskey under the recombinant stars, and Bobby, who loved to go on about things, would reminisce about his dead wife who had contracted a disease from sleeping too close to the fan. On Sundays they would not move a muscle. They would just sit there like two piles of coins quietly warming through the afternoon, then slowly cooling off over the evening.Bobby puts on his sound jacket. Shards of hospital bed are locked in the bass drum. Through the worn dolichoid rafters i can see birds flying over the practice room. The snare is stuffed with traffic tickets and out the window there's my horse walking on the stream, the stream always behind schedule. There's a dust mote hawk landing in slo-mo on my guitar. Hazel's saying something about Earnest Wourls over in Tullahoma who'd had a dream about being a cougar sleepwalking on Polk's grave and how that was bad luck for the region. (\"Those that look through the window are darkened.\" All those faces passed down through the centuries that kickstart the rivers and grow like nerve endings in a coal cart until until they are key-cold and shoved through the repaired death gate, a catafalque set free and released into the dirtways.) \"And John and his father trap mink under the chain lightning in the libraries they've landed in, where all the talk about shadow-dappled paths is typeset, published, and poured into a break in the earth,\" Hazel murmured to no one in the room. You might think it was all words and dark ticket as we began to play \"R.M.T.\" in the swarming weather chart sundown, and it was.Outside, you would still hear the music, hear someone yelling \"actors dreaming got nowhere to stay/ see my sheet go walking run and fly\" and it would sound better from far away, like the faded sketch of a long since forgotten pacer at the downs, all the while platinum ticks are dropping off the trees like little Romans, onto an auburn shower curtain half-buried in the forest floor.Already gone were the golden days of E-Z credit, the days of approaching squat south-central skylines from underneath the ice blue tides of the windshield, the five cent war comets, howling saran yaps and careening school chords. All that was left, looking like two lost eyeballs on the field after Spotsylvania, were a couple of black plastic busted knobs in the dirt, one for tone and one for rinse.This place is like a haunted turnpike, closed down for years , where things still happen in the little turnoffs to the renowned teenagers that never come back (sold to the haunt in the black church). If you come in the day and you're lucky, you might catch a picture of two sweatbees fucking on a coke mirror. You might see my horse breaking across a white wine coloured clearing, or maybe hear the old chords coming, for no real reason, out of sockets in the walls. (\"Because there's an answering machine clogged with ice, deep in the courthouse mountains where he lived and died in the breech.\")"
