Jelly beans and cookie dough

Country restroom on a radio

I got a number on my name

It’s hard to rise above the shame

I’m a branded man made in the mold.

These terms engulf the waking mind.

Like cherry, grape and lemon-limeLike candy corn and licoriceLike bubble gum and Swedish fish

Living in a candy jail

With peppermint bars

Peanut brittle bunk beds

And marshmallow walls.

Where the guards are graciousAnd the grounds are grand

And the warden really listens

And he understands.
