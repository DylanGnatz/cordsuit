## Bright Flight/ "Tennessee" EP

By Jillian Steinberger, (http://www.neumu.net/ neumu)In over a decade, the Silver Jews (AKA David Berman and whoever he chooses to record with) have never quite fit into the musical landscape, existing in a genre twilight zone, subverting the codes. Berman makes his own rules and doesn't always follow them. His roots are in the music of American youth when he was coming up in the '80s - punk. He records for Drag City, an indie label. On both his latest album and his EP, Berman identifies most closely as a countrified artist - although his music is beyond country and alt.country and tacitly offers a criticism of both. Berman's often compared to rock heavyweights. Bob Dylan, for example, although they don't share much beyond common ancestry and a voice with a bit of scratch. Lou Reed? That might be valid, since the band has an early seven-inch called "The Silver Jews and Nico" (1993) - but it's not. While they've been compared to Neil Young, The Jews are not like Neil Young - they are wry, post-modern. As for Tom Waits, Berman's voice is hardly the same gravelly bear, and the songs differ vastly in tone and texture. And although the Silver Jews have been seen as a Pavement side project (members of that now-defunct über-indie supergroup play on previous albums, but not this one), it isn't. The Jews are so often misunderstood. There's a boho masculinity about the Silver Jews' music. Lore has it the "band" (originally called Ectoslavia) began as a trio of University of Virginia, Charlottesville, graduate students (Berman, plus ex-Pavement members Stephen Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich) sitting among beer cans and cigarette butts, inventing lo-fi tunes for friends. Eventually they moved to New York and left the little songs on people's answering machines (including Sonic Youth's, whose number they reputedly finagled from a girl at a record store). While his sometime bandmates dabbled with stardom, the apparently incorruptible Berman has stuck to his indie roots. He refuses to tour, saying he's not a performer, and live performances offer no value above and beyond the recorded songs. Yet he does make appearances, drawing caricatures at record stores, most recently in New York (Kim's on St. Mark's Place) and London (Rough Trade, for one quid). Very common-sense in Berman's world. An MFA in Creative Writing and published poet, Berman emphasizes the lyric, with no shortage of attention to songwriting or musicianship. He is the author of "Actual Air" (Open City, 2000) and numerous pieces in that beloved Situationist rag, The Baffler. Richard Brautigan, psychedelic beat author of deep teen fave "In Watermelon Sugar," comes up regularly as a comparative reference. At Berman's request - and to their purported disappointment - Malkmus and Nastanovich have taken a break from the latest project, although word is they'll return for future recordings. To protect the Silver Jews from the continued perception of Pavement-side-project status (the opposite could be argued), Berman opted for experienced studio musicians. Props to them; they play beautifully together and with Berman. William Tyler plays acoustic and electric guitar, while Lambchop member Paul Niehaus, who has sessioned with Yo La Tengo, adds slide and twang with wave table and pedal steel guitar. Keyboards go to Tony Crow (Lambchop). Michael Fellows (Royal Trux, Rites of Spring) returns with his bass from the Jews' 1998 release, "American Water," with drummer Tim Barnes. Cassie Marrett adds a welcome female dimension, and Berman has found his vocal female doppelgänger in her sweet, textured, country-punk voice. Closer listenings, particularly to the LP, reveal how grounded it is in its sense of place and history. Overall, the new work seems to be about movement and making tough choices - having the courage to live life according to one's vision and determining one's destiny. It is about what happens if you don't. It is about yearning - to be a better person, for communion with another, for a better world. It is about when the masculine joins the feminine and the worthwhile challenges of negotiating long-term romantic partnerships. It is packed with images - screen doors banging in the wind, freight trains rolling West, God when he was young, plug-in reindeer, floating hatchets and rhinestone suits. It is about the South - a condemnation of hypocrisy, rednecks, horseracing, guns and throwing in the towel too early. And it recalls and questions the meaning of American history. The songs are by turns tender, sweet, sexy, wry, tragic and mournful. Some are romantic ("Tennessee," "Room Games and Diamond Rain"), while others are spiritual ("Slow Education", "Death of an Heir of Sorrows"). "Slow Education" opens Bright Flight; the album's first lyrics soothe the weary adult soul ("When God was young, he made the wind and the sun/ And since then, it's been a slow education"). "Everybody's going down on themselves" in this NC-17 lullaby, featuring Berman's none-too-scratchy vocals and Marrett adding a pretty backup. I like the rhythm, the keyboards are right on, the guitars dish out the perfect twang, and even George Washington makes an appearance. "Room Games and Diamond Rain" follows. Again, the rhythm's on the mark and that same pretty twang from "Slow Education" weaves in. The song's about settling into romantic commitment; the affecting melody and rhyming lyrics might get schmaltzy ("You keep finding and reminding me/ That you only can be kind to me"), but the chorus takes it in other direction, presenting a kaleidoscope of compelling images ("It's a fox hunt, it's an f-stop/It's a ten-acre wood") that balance the song out. Sweet but contemplative, "Room Games" is one of my favorite songs on Bright Flight. I like how it sounds, what Berman talks about and the way he expresses himself - it's tender, but not saccharine. Some of Berman's songs have an onomatopoetic quality. Many songs in the history of country have sounded like trains (Johnny Cash's "Folsom Prison Blues" is a good example). On Bright Flight I do believe I've heard my first horse-galloping song, the instrumental "Transylvania Blues" - horse-galloping music from a fourth-generation, Southern Fried, American Jewish perspective. (Overall, the instrumentals are respites from the intense lyricism of the songs.) The 4-song EP, "Tennessee," was a teaser released two weeks before the 10-song Bright Flight. I figure Berman didn't include the other tracks on the album because they didn't fit Bright Flight's narrative thrust. On both the EP and LP, "Tennessee" is the centerpiece, the heart, of the new work. Berman conveys his agenda with two unsubtle lines, "Punk rock died when the first kid said/ 'Punk's not dead, punk's not dead.' " (A friend argues that it died when Joe Strummer got his teeth fixed.) With this shout-out, D.C. says he's not working in a vacuum. He's drawing from tradition (punk), but he's not stuck in it. Berman appeals to youth as if to say, "Think for yourself. Invent new forms; don't trot out the old tired forms. " It's an important message, and typical Berman. In "Tennessee" the narrator hits the road with his gal pal and flees to Nashville. Acoustic guitar lends a folky feel, while electric guitars provide a twangy lead and an airy Western texture. Marrett's voice and delivery are perfect on this duet. The line, "Louisville is death" has caused speculation that Berman uses "Tennessee" to reveal a distaste for this significant village in the world of indie, one that developed while living with his girlfriend while she finished school. Louisville's indie stars include Berman's Drag City label mates, Will Oldham (Bonnie Prince Billy, Palace) and David Pajo (Papa M/Aerial M, Slint, Tortoise), neither of whom play often in their hometown. Bob Nastanovich has claimed that Louisville is only good for compulsive gamblers, and that the punk and indie scenes have died. The image of "Horseleg Swastikas" and lyrics like "My horse's legs look like four brown shotguns" ("Time Will Break the World") evoke a town populated by fascists perverting nature at the racetracks. Hence, the male voice's desire in "Tennessee" to make for Nashville, where he can juggle with the rubble of Southern music and build something new. On the EP, "I'm Gonna Love the Hell Out of You" is a sexy number heavy on guitar, tambourine and Berman telling a story about a "Christian rock ingénu" who wants to "love the hell out of you. " Where are those Nancy Sinatra boots when you need 'em? This song makes you want to stomp around on the table tops. If you don't know how that feels, listen and you'll know. The most fun of Berman's new crop, it works on the EP but would have disrupted the flow of the somber, introspective LP. A demo was originally released as a Jane Magazine CD. Berman originally drew me in with a deja vu line that captured a previously unarticulated concept: "We're trapped inside the song," he and Malkmus wailed in "New Orleans" on 1994's Starlite Walker. Now I'm trapped inside Berman's latest project. And I love this rebel Jew. (Note: Bright Light gets an "8" rating; the "Tennessee" EP gets a "6" rating.)
